1998-04-01,1/4/1998,Türkiye Dışişleri Bakanı Sayın İsmail Cem'in İtalyan mevkidaşı Sayın Lamberto Dini'ye Yasadışı İnsan Ticaretine İlişkin Cevabına Gönderdiği Mektup 4 Ocak 1998,"Letter sent by Turkish Foreign Minister Mr. İsmail Cem in reply to his Italian counterpart Mr. Lamberto Dini regarding Illegal Trafficking of Human-Being January 4,1998",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/letter-sent-by-turkish-foreign-minister-mr_-ismail-cem-in-reply-to-his-italian-counterpart-mr_-lamberto-dini-regarding-illegal-trafficking-of-human-being__br_january-4__1998.en.mfa,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Dear Colleague and Friend, 
 
 I have received your letter of 30 December 1997 and given careful consideration to its contents. 
 
 We have been following the repercussions of the attempted illegal immigration to Italy. We understand your concerns and we symphatize with them. To be helpful, I would like to convey our views on the points that you raise and on some others which I consider as essential. 
 
 1- I do not agree with the repeated analogy made with ""exodus"" in your text. If the analyses of the recent events is based on wrong presumptions it will be difficult to reach genuine solutions. 
 
 I am sensitive on this terminology for Turkey has both historically and contemporarily constituted a safe heaven, a country which ""sheltered the exodist"". 
 
 Let me recall that in 1988 and in 1991, more than half a million asylum seekers from Northern Iraq have found shelter and assistance in Turkey. Iranian masses fleeing the newly founded radical regime, Bulgarian Turks and Bosnians were welcomed in our country, as this was the case in our history, when tens of thousand of persecuted Jews from Spain, Portugal and Germany found tolerance and a home in Turkey. 
 
 2- The current problem is a blatant case of illegal trafficking in human beings, an extremely serious form of organized crime. This criminal activity is based on the exploitation of the understandable desire to have a better life. To present this basic cause as a romanticised human rights problem deviates from reality, encourages those who organize illegal immigration and serves their interest. It provides the traffickers with a moral justification. Furthermore, official and ministerial statements reported by the Italian press and which are perceived as promises to grant political asylum to illegal immigrants would probably encourage and trigger new waves of migration. 
 
 3- Illegal migration has always been a source of concern for Turkey. We have consistently sought multilateral cooperation against all form of organized crime and international terrorism. 
 
 We have drawn attention to their interrelation, to the funding of terrorism by organized crime like the organization of illegal migrations and to networks of crime established in Western Europe under various guises. 
 
 4- Our efforts to devise and implement common measures against organized crime including illegal immigration have so far remained inconclusive. This is largely due to false analyses or to miscalculation prevailing in some Western European countries. Their policies meant in practice a tolerance for terror related activities. These acts were, in principle, aimed to Turkey and not considered as a danger to the host country. As a matter of fact, the current case of illegal immigration is just one of the offshoots of the complaisant attitude existing in some parts of Western Europe. The events in Italy are the logical follow up of some 90.000 such smuggled illegal immigrants to Germany in recent years, organized by similar networks and encouraged by similar attitudes (Paul Geitner, ""Illegal Migrants Turn to Smugglers"", Associated Press, 19/04/1997). 
 
 We hope that the countries concerned will be more receptive to our persistent calls for combating international terrorism and organized crime. 
 
 5- The illegal trafficking of human beings has been a subject of consideration between Italy and Turkey and it has recently been agreed to make use of and develop the provisions of the existing agreements. We remain committed to such cooperation with Italy and to work for its refinement. 
 
 (a) Following our meeting with Deputy Minister Fassino, last November, the Italian Undersecretary for the Interior Ministry had contacts in Ankara. My staff had relevant interviews with your Ambassador in Ankara. 
 
 (b) In these contacts, we have proposed the meeting of the Turkish-Italian Joint Committee to look for enhanced cooperation against organized crime and for joint initiatives. It seems that the Italian side has not yet responded to this proposal. We are ready to cooperate with our Italian counterparts on all possible joint efforts. 
 
 (c) We are taking all measures needed to stem illegal immigration as an organized crime, through or from Turkey. But I would underline as well the need for dealing effectively with its connections in the favorable environment that it generally finds in its host West-European countries. 
 
 Yours Sincerely,

 TURKEY'S SPECIFIC DEMANDS FROM SYRIA 
 
 In order to normalize our relations, we expect Syria to comply with the basic norms and principles of international relations.In this regard, the following specific demands should be met: 
 
 *Given the fact that Turkish-Syrian relations were seriously +damaged by Syrian support for terrorism, we want Syria to accept formally its obligations and renounce its previous stand on this matter. These obligations should include a formal commitment not to give terrorists support, sanctuary, and financial assistance. Syria should also prosecute PKK perpetrators and extradite to Turkey the chief of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan and his collaborators. 
 
 *Within this framework, Syria should not: 
 
 * Permit camps for terrorist training to operate in territories under its control, 
 
 * Provide weapons, logistic materials to the PKK, 
 
 * Provide fraud identification documents to PKK members, 
 
 * Help terrorists for their legal passage and infiltration into Turkey, 
 
 * Permit the propaganda activities of the terrorists organization, 
 
 * Allow the PKK to operate in accommodations in its territory, 
 
 * Facilitate the passages of terrorists from the third countries (Europe, Greece, Southern Cyprus, Iran, Libya, Armenia) to northern Iraq and Turkey. 
 
 * Cooperation in all activities aimed at fighting terrorism. 
 
 * Refrainment from inciting other countries which are members of the Arab League against Turkey. 
 
 * In the light of the above, unless Syria rescinds from these acts immediately, with all the consequences, Turkey reserves the right to exercise her inherent right of self-defense, and under all circumstances to demand just compensation for the loss of life and property. Indeed, these views were transmitted to Syria through diplomatic channels on 23 January 1996. However, our warnings have fallen on deaf ears."

 As was stated by our Foreign Minister on 17 December, Turkey attaches great importance to the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity and political unity, and believes that Iraq, as an important country in the region, must comply fully with the UN Security Council resolutions, and thereby should re-take its position in the international community of nations. At this stage, we sincerely hope that, Iraq first and foremost and the international community and the UN Security Council will increase their efforts to this end.

In this context, the terrorist organization ""November 17"" has threatened to take action against the personnel of the Turkish General Consulate in Athens. 
 
 On the other hand, a manifesto of the organization called ""Greek Liberty Front of Captive Homelands"" has been published under the heading ""the Agents of Ankara will be punished"" in an extreme rightist newspaper in Athens. The manifesto referred to Turkish diplomats as targets and called upon the extremist groups to take action against the Turkish Diplomatic Missions in Greece. 
 
 It is known that members of some authoritative Greek circles frequently encourage the terrorist groups in Greece through their statements. On the other hand, Greece's support of PKK terrorism finds its expression in the statements of the Greek officials. In such an environment, we remind once more the Greek authorities of their responsibilities, expect them to regard seriously the threats against our Diplomatic Missions and take appropriate measures for the security of the personnel as well as the premises of the Turkish Diplomatic missions in Greece."

It has been announced by the Italian government that the terrorist chief was compelled to leave Italy where he had been staying for some time. 
 
 2. As a result of Turkey’s determined efforts, the terrorist chief had been forced to leave Syria and prevented from staying in Moscow. 
 
 3. The terrorist chief attempted to make Roma a center for terrorism and called for wide support in Europe for separatist terror. These attempts have been rendered fruitless by us. Public in Western Europe finally started to realise the real and ugly face of the terrorist organisation. 
 
 4. Turkey, as a state of law, has always approached the issue from the viewpoint of international cooperation against combating terrorism and demanded that the terrorist chief be brought before the justice. Yet, it has been observed that the Italian authorities, unable to find a way out of this issue that they themselves had created, acted in contravention of legal and judicial requirements. 
 
 5. Despite Turkey’s insistence that law be applied, Italian authorities, with a unilateral decision, made it possible for the terrorist chief to leave Rome. 
 
 6. Turkey will maintain its determined attitude. Terrorist chief will not be able to escape from justice. 
 
 7. All steps required by the developments are being taken in coordination with the other government agencies."

During the terrorist chief’s stay in Rome, the Italian government received poor marks in terms of justice and law. It failed to fulfil its obligations under international agreements to combat terrorism, and distorted the judiciary process in Italy by exerting political influence. 
 
 2. This being the case, it has been deemed meaningless and unfitting for the Italian Prime Minister to state that “Turkey did not cooperate on the subject of international tribunal”, to display an attitude of not knowing “where” the terrorist chief went, and to claim that “the subject will be examined at international level”. 
 
 3. It has finally received wide acceptance, also with the help of the ugliness displayed by the terrorist chief in Italy, that such pursuits which were obviously undertaken under threats and pressure from the terrorist organisation, are devoid of realism and seriousness. Turkey, from the beginning, has followed an open policy based on international law, and demanded that the chief of this known terrorist organisation be brought to justice. 
 
 4. At this stage, what is expected of the Italian authorities, is to fulfil their international commitments to combat terrorism, to cooperate with Turkey in this field and not to permit the terrorist organisation and its affiliations to function in Italy. 
 
 5. Turkey will maintain its determination to combat terrorism. Terrorist chief, no matter where he may escape, will be held accountable before justice for the crimes he committed in our country."

 1) Upon these developments necessary initiatives have been taken in those countries immediately. In a statement made by the Italian Government yesterday afternoon, the allegations claiming that the terrorist chief was in Italy were categorically rejected, and it was emphasized that his return to Italy was regarded as not possible. This quick and sensitive reaction that the Italian Government displayed made us hopeful about establishing an effective co-operation between our countries to combat terrorism. However, with regard to the news indicating that the terrorist chief had landed on an airport on the north of Milano this time, the attitude that the Italian Government will follow will show how far we could depend on this hope. From the statement made by the Ministry of Justice of the Netherlands this morning, it is understood that no permission was given to the terrorist chief to land at the Rotterdam Airport. Concerning the news about the terrorist's entry in Greece; the Greeek ambassador who was invited to our Ministry today stated that the terrorist was not in Greece and that he would not be permitted to come to Greece. However, according to the news received following this meeting it was heard that the chief of the terrorist organisation had come to the Athens Airport on a private plane and that he was still waiting there. Also some information has been obtained from various resources indicating that the terrorist chief was in Greece. In a situation like this, the Greek authorities must immediately arrest this person in order to extradite him to Turkey. The Greek ambassador who was invited once again upon these developments said that the news in question did not reflect the truth. In view of this contradictory situation, we will continue to follow the developments. 
 
 As it can be remembered, our Government made it clear that it would consider it a hostile act if this terrorist is given shelter by a neighboring country. 
 
 2) After the terrorist chief has fled leaving behind children with an obscure destiny after having forced them into terrorist actions, it is apparent that he is only searching for a secure future for himself by hiring private planes and lawyers with the money he gained from PKK's drug trafficking, money laundering and extortion and that he is only struggling to take care of his individual interests. In this struggle, it is known that the terrorist chief is supported by drug trafficking, crime organisations and mafia. 
 
 3) From the information obtained by us it has been understood that the terrorist chief who is the first one to blame for great number of murders and other crimes that are committed by the terrorist organisation so far was not successful in finding a shelter in some Europe countries. 
 
 We expect all European countries to locate this terrorist's whereabouts and hand him over to the authorities to be held accountable for the crimes he committed."

From the statement made by the Ministry of Justice of the Netherlands this morning, it is understood that no permission was given to the terrorist chief to land at the Rotterdam Airport. Concerning the news about the terrorist's entry in Greece; the Greeek ambassador who was invited to our Ministry today stated that the terrorist was not in Greece and that he would not be permitted to come to Greece. However, according to the news received following this meeting it was heard that the chief of the terrorist organisation had come to the Athens Airport on a private plane and that he was still waiting there. Also some information has been obtained from various resources indicating that the terrorist chief was in Greece. In a situation like this, the Greek authorities must immediately arrest this person in order to extradite him to Turkey. The Greek ambassador who was invited once again upon these developments said that the news in question did not reflect the truth. In view of this contradictory situation, we will continue to follow the developments. 
 
 As it can be remembered, our Government made it clear that it would consider it a hostile act if this terrorist is given shelter by a neighboring country. 
 
 2) After the terrorist chief has fled leaving behind children with an obscure destiny after having forced them into terrorist actions, it is apparent that he is only searching for a secure future for himself by hiring private planes and lawyers with the money he gained from PKK's drug trafficking, money laundering and extortion and that he is only struggling to take care of his individual interests. In this struggle, it is known that the terrorist chief is supported by drug trafficking, crime organisations and mafia. 
 
 3) From the information obtained by us it has been understood that the terrorist chief who is the first one to blame for great number of murders and other crimes that are committed by the terrorist organisation so far was not successful in finding a shelter in some Europe countries. 
 
 We expect all European countries to locate this terrorist's whereabouts and hand him over to the authorities to be held accountable for the crimes he committed."

In these efforts, with the help of objective data, we hope that a just conclusion will be reached in conformity with the letter and the spirit of the related Security Council resolutions by taking into consideration the grave humanitarian conditions in Iraq and multidimensional effects of this condition with due regard to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and to take necessary measures to prevent Iraq from obtaining these kinds of weapons henceforth. 
 
 Turkey, as a regional country and as Iraq's neighbor sincerely supports protection of Iraq's territorial integrity and political unity.

 I have a news for you and for our dear citizens. Since 3 am this morning, Abdullah Öcalan, chief of the separatist terrorist organisation called PKK is in Turkey. We had stated wherever he might be in the world, our state would be able to capture him. This promise of the state has now been fulfilled. The promise made to our martyrs’ mothers has been kept. Öcalan, who has been disowned by the entire world has now found himself in Turkey’s hands. He now will be held accountable before the independent Turkish justice for all that he did and for all that he forced others do for him. It is high time for everybody to realise that in Turkey one can go nowhere through terrorism and that no one can challenge our state. 
 
 This morning, I want to make a call especially to the young ones who fell in Ocalan’s trap or that of his men and supporters. I want to reach out to those young ones who have inflicted deep pain to mothers, fathers and to our nation by throwing themselves into fire in the mountains, in the caves: While you were made accessories to murders for years, while you were living in misery in mountain caves, the person you thought was your leader was living in luxury in posh mansions. Some of his collaborators were also living comfortably in certain European countries. 
 
 I call on to those who fell into their trap: You are now at a dead end. Surrender yourselves to the justice of the state. Then, of course our nation will make sure that you can benefit from the Act of Repentenence that is now before the Parliament. Re-unite with your mothers, fathers, and put an end to your separation from your loved ones. Use your power not to take lives of innocent human beings, but to increase the prosperity of our people hand in hand with the state. Say “enough” to those who waste your lives, who throw you right into the fire, who incite you to hunger strikes or acts of suicide. 
 
 Before I conclude, I would like to give you a brief information about his capture, but I cannot go into the details. I can say this: He was caught without anyone getting hurt, including himself. He was caught following our silent but intensive efforts that lasted 12 days in different countries and different continents. There were only 10 people in Turkey who knew about this operation. There was no leakage. Had there been the slightest leak, this operation would not have been successful. The operation has been accomplished thanks to a close and harmonious cooperation between the Turkish Intelligence Organisation and the Turkish General Staff. I extend my thanks and appreciation to them. A difficult job has been accomplished. The rest is now in the hands of the independent judiciary. 
 
 May God protect our nation and all humankind from terror and wars. 
 
 QUESTION: In which country was he last? 
 
 ANSWER : We are not going to go into any detail on this subject. I ask you not to be inquisitive about it. 
 
 QUESTION : Can you give us information as to his present whereabouts? 
 
 ANSWER : He is currently in Turkey, but he did not yet go to the place he will be kept. When he does, we will announce that too. 
 
 QUESTION: Is he in Istanbul? 
 
 ANSWER : For the time being, I do not deem it appropriate to disclose any detail. 
 
 QUESTION : Is he going to be interrogated by MIT? 
 
 ANSWER : No, no. This will be done by the authorised judicial authorities. 
 
 Thank you."

 In the Middle East the protests were centered in Lebanon, Iran, and Turkey, none of which is surprising. Under the protection of Beirut's overlords in Syria, Lebanon has since 1984 been a haven of PKK training and recruitment. And Iran, not exactly a friend of either Kurdish independence or democratic expression, is ruled by a regime for whom any weakening of Turkey is welcome. As for Turkey, its southeastern region remains infiltrated by the PKK. 
 
 More interesting was the geographic scope of demonstrations in Europe: from Berlin, London, Stockholm, Milan, Rome, Marseille, Amsterdam, and Brussels in the west, to Bucharest and Moscow in the east; and also in smaller cities such as Heilbronn, Dresden, and Leipzig. The targets -- all highly prized public relations objectives -- were diplomatic missions, mostly Greek, as well as Israeli and Kenyan, and offices of international organizations in Switzerland. 
 
 The convenient conclusion, shared by willfully ignorant members of the media and leftist parties in Europe and America, was that these protests abundantly demonstrated universal Kurdish support for the man known as ""Apo"" and his Maoist PKK. The actual size of the demonstrations, however, suggest a carefully coordinated attempt by a small group bent on publicity. The following figures are taken from pro-PKK internet sources; in Berlin, there were 150 protesters, including children; in Frankfurt 50, and in Bonn between 20 and 30 -- all in a country with half a million immigrants of Kurdish origin, out of an estimated West European total of 850,000. In Milan the protesters totalled 20, and in Rome a similar number --although there an Italian communist cabinet minister was involved. In London there were 50, the same number as in Bern, and in Moscow, which historically has been supportive of the PKK, 15 were arrested in the takeover of the Greek embassy. ""Kurdish"" protests also took place in Melbourne, Montreal, and Toronto -- and a small, quiet, almost invisible group demonstrated in Washington. 
 
 In addition to the small turnout there are three other reasons to conclude that these events were neither ""spontaneous"" nor broadly ""Kurdish"" but rather the actions of a well-organized underground terrorist organization amply funded through heroin trafficking, racketeering, and illegal alien smuggling operations in Western Europe. 
 
 First, it strains belief that ""Kurdish"" hostage-taking throughout Europe, Canada, and Australia was spontaneous. Even the spectacular acts of fanatical self-immolation had already been rehearsed during Ocalan's initial arrest in Italy last year. The telling evidence of planning is that -- contrary to the PKK's long- standing ideological belief that the main enemy is ultimately ""imperialism"" (i.e., the United States) -- there were no attacks against U.S. installations. The reason is clear: the PKK Central Committee controlling the ""Kurdish"" demonstrations realizes that, after the PKK's military defeat in Turkey, provoking a hostile reaction from the American public and Congress would work against its real strategic goal -- a public relations campaign to discredit Turkey. 
 
 Second, the PKK strategy of blurring the distinction between the Kurds in the diaspora and Its own murderous Maoism should be seen for what it is -- another aspect of the public relations campaign. The overwhelming majority of Kurds In Europe and even in Turkey do not support, belong to, or want anything to do with the PKK or ""Apo."" Those who do should be treated as a security threat everywhere. 
 
 Third, as an ""internationalist"" organization -- and one need only check the PKK's 1995 Fifth Congress documents, all freely available on the Internet - the group's ideology and practice is profoundly incompatible with democracy. Sharing the same Maoist legacy with the Khmer Rouge and Shining Path, the PKK is an immediate threat to free societies in Turkey and throughout Europe. 
 
 Europe and the United States have to prepare to deal harshly and promptly with the Maoist remnants of Ocalan's organization. Unfortunately, too many European politicians, media outlets, and legal authorities have replaced common sense with romantic ""feelings"" about the Kurds, an error with potentially catastrophic consequences. It is incomprehensible that MED-TV, a pro-PKK satellite outfit, can continue advocating Ocalan's cause from Belgium under a British licence. It is shameful that self-proclaimed human rights groups should suddenly be preoccupied with Ocalan's ""rights"" rather than those of his Kurdish victims or Turkish sovereignty. And it is unreasonable for governments not known for their effective justice systems -- Russians, Iranians, Italians, and Greeks among others -- to be providing advice to Turkey. 
 
 Indeed, government responses to the wave of ""spontaneous Kurdish reactions"" to Ocalan's capture varied, largely in direct relation to the size of their Kurdish community and, more significantly, the nature of the government. In Romania the anti- communist government had no qualms about beating up the few Kurds trying to demonstrate illegally; the police there were already encouraged by their unexpected success in defeating a pro-communist quasi insurrection by violent miners. In Germany the leftist government, under attack from the opposition and the public for renouncing its own arrest warrant against Ocalan for crimes committed on its territory, threatened to ""deport"" Kurdish troublemakers. How credible that threat is remains to be seen, but 
 
 in light of a German intelligence report (done under the previous government) that estimated the local PKK cadres at 10,000 with an additional 40,000 supporters, the PKK threat to domestic law and order is indeed serious. 
 
 The PKK's game is obvious: to galvanize a broad spectrum of the European Left on its behalf. On February 25, taking advantage of the funeral of three PKK militants killed on February 17 while trying to take over the Israeli consulate, they managed to assemble a crowd of 8,500 people in Berlin. That demonstration brought together pacifists, the city's ubiquitous street cafe activists, as well as Kurds who appear to have come to express ethnic solidarity with their dead kin rather than ideological support for the PKK. Forty-four were arrested for displaying the banned PKK symbols. 
 
 The results, however, may not have been what they expected. The February 25 demonstration in Berlin seems to have been enough for the German government to declare the PKK a ""terrorist 
 
 organization,"" upgrading its earlier designation of the PKK as a ""criminal organization."" As for the nervous Swiss, after some 50(!) Kurdish militants threatened foreign embassies in Bern, and a few others did the same in Geneva and Zurich -- again in solidarity with those killed in Berlin -- they openly considered using the army for riot control. 
 
 The big losers, naturally enough (given their long-standing and not so well hidden support for Ocalan and the PKK), were the Greek and Greek-Cypriot governments -- both of which have been involved in the Ocalan imbroglio, to the discomfiture of the European Union. The wave of PICK assaults on their embassies in Europe, even though they turned out to be non-violent, must have been more than disappointing. 
 
 Despite the PKK's totalitarian Ideology and criminal record, Greek, Italian, British and German parliamentarians have already gone on record supporting it, and former lawyers for German and 
 
 Italian terrorists are also openly trying to manipulate European Union concerns about Ocalan's trial. Such actions work quite effectively to the advantage of PKK terrorism and its strategic goals. 
 
 The issue, ultimately, is one of historic memory. Too many leftist politicians in Europe (some of whom now share government power) never believed that the Cold War made sense -- that Marxism was a threat to freedom, or that ""bourgeois"" democratic values were worth defending. But the Cold War is not dead as far as the PKK's Maoists are concerned, and they may succeed where the European New Left never did -- for they have learned to pick up a new vocabulary without setting aside an old program. They have discovered that their methods, goals, and ideology can all beforgotten, indeed sanctified in the name of ""self-determination"" and ""human rights."""

 2. Between the EU and Turkey there has in recent years arisen a disheartening development, primarily caused by the wish of an officious left wing to profile itself at the cost of a country which-inexplicably and treacherously in the view of this wing-prefers non-socialist democracy but cannot yet honour all the quality demands of the West. 
 
 That the explanation of the imperfection might be rooted in the Turkish history and the Muslim tradition as well as in the country's unfortunate position between Arab and communist dictatorships, even responsible governments chose to ignore. 
 
 The situation deteriorated when Turkey's untiring critics saw their chance - precisely like they earlier saw it in Cambodia, Cuba and Nicaragua- in a rebellion organized by Abdullah Öcalan, the now imprisoned boss of the Kurdish Labour Party (PKK), and Maoistic-inspired, Syrian-paid terror machine. 
 
 To Turkey the optics are different. There is no war between Turks and Kurds, and in Turkey there are no mentionable traces of a wish for a Kurdish State. On the contrary, a war is going on between the army and PKK's armed gangs whose clear task is to destroy the only secular democracy in The Middle East. 
 
 In step with the fact that the EU countries let themselves be influenced by loud-mouthed extremists, their prestige and influence disappeared in Turkey. Even democratic circles in Istanbul are now viewing Europe with distrust and are accusing her of distorting the relations between Turks and Kurds and o refusing Turkey accession to The European Union, a kind of prolongation of the Crusades mentality so too speak. 
 
 The idea of the official Europe was naturally not that they wanted to disassociate themselves from 65 million people, a fast growing economy and an enormous country situated on the strategically important bridge between Asia, Africa and Europe. But this was the outcome. The unofficial agenda gained ground because the European Governments, including the Danish, acted hesitatingly and unwise. 
 
 Maybe the left-wing's naivists and squallers should be ignored for a period and efforts should be made to concentrate on the Turkish reality, which is that the Turkish democracy functions, that Turks and Kurds generally live excellently together, that far more than a hundred Kurds are Members of the Turkish Parliament and that the state on behalf of its total population has both the right and the duty to defend itself - latest manifested in the arrest of Öcalan, followed by the military's incursion in Northern Iraq, a region which is outside the control of the Baghdad rule, and where PKK has a series of bases. 
 
 Such an initial position prior to the coming trial of Öcalan might remedy rather a lot of unnecessarily tense European-Turkish relations."

All aboard for Midnight Express. What damage that film has done. It is regularly shown on British television, and has impregnated the mind of a whole generation, to the point at which Turkey is permanently on the defensive - her police villified, her courts regarded as kangaroo, even her children as rather on the fat side. 
 
 This is currently being reflected in the reporting of the Abdullah Ocalan affair. He will not get a fair trial and the police - large chaps with large moustaches will beat him up in the dead of night in his Island prison on the Sea of Marmara; will he even be buggered? (Midnight Express, passim). The Europarliament will have its stalwarts -Pauline Green, as it happens, is an ex-policewoman- who will sound off: this is no way to treat minorities fighting for their rights. Who knows, the Council of Europe may be next, volunteering its judges to make sure that Ocalan has 'a fair trial'. These judges might include the Czech one who left France in 1948 to go back to liberated, socialist Prague, or maybe it will be the Georgian. And there , is also Harold Pinter, lecturing away about Kurdish rights as previously he has lectured us about the Sandinistas (whose sinister connections are laid out in Vladimir Bukovsky's Jugement a Moscou, based on Politburo records). 
 
 So far the tenor of British comment on matters Kurdish and Turkish has been a statesmanlike, 'Yes, Ocalan is a terrorist, he kills children' and so forth; 'but on the other hand' . . . that fatal British 'on the other hand', which you know is going to offer you a poison pill. Harold Pinter tells us that the Kurds are oppressed. They do not have the right to use their own language. Talk Kurdish, and into clink you go. Leyla Zana, a rather good-looking Kurdish woman with long legs and black tresses, is in prison for 15 years for just wanting to be free. There are writers banged up for the same length of time. There has even been 'ethnic cleansing claims' Le Monde in an editorial. Kurdish villages have been destroyed, the inhabitants cleared off. 
 
 The Turks are getting quite angry with this sort of thing. Ocalan is a very nasty piece of work and the PKK, far from being a movement for national liberation, is actually a Maoist affair, rather similar to Sendero Luminoso. Its specialities included drug-running -when Ocalan was seeking refuge in Belorussia, he could apparently offer 1,000 million dollars- and it massacred entire families, tiny children and all, in order to intimidate the many Kurds who took the side of the Turkish state. There were organisations in London and a lady called Julie Flint who claimed that these acts were carried out by the Turkish army. However, since Ocalan's own lieutenant, Sakik, was captured and confessed, we now know that there was never any truth in those claims. No doubt Ocalan himself will soon confirm this. 
 
 Yet we are told by the Pinters that the Kurds are a people fighting Bravehearht-fashion for their freedom. London has seen these demonstrations; as have many other European cities. Word in some Nato circles is that Kosovo is only the start: if the Albanians are to be freed, so must the Kurds. In fact, a Kurdistan might just enable us to replace Saddam Hussein's Iraq with a whole new country, a sort of Mesopotamia rediviva. 
 
 There may very well be a case for a Kurdish entity in northem Iraq. But it is Turkey, which has a free media, that is exposed to criticism for her handling of the Kurdish question. Two points need to be made. First, two- thirds of the Kurds now live in western and central Anatolia and they do not vote for the political party, Hadep, which claims to speak for Kurds. In the past week, with Turkish nationalist feeling running high, there have been very few incidents of Turkish-Kurdish conflict. We might see some instances of urban terrorism when the Ocalan trial gets underway; the PKK's publicity machine in the West will be working overtirne. Television was, on the whole, quite sympathetic to those crowds who gathered outside and inside the Greek embassy last week. We shall see. 
 
 But there is another, important point. The Kurds are not Kosovo. Leaving aside the legal argument, that Kosovo is a constitutional entity, there has been almost no intermarriage between Serbs and Albanians, whereas intermarriage between Turks and Kurds (though not, for some reason, between Kurds and Arabs) is frequent. Ocalan himself was saying after his capture that his mother was a Turk. Besides, there is an all-important question: Kosovo speaks Albanian, but in 'Kurdistan' there are several languages, which are not mutually intelligible. This is why 'Kurdish culture' is a concept very difficult to translate into reality. 
 
 The word from Mr Pinter is that Kurdish culture is suppressed, that in the end Ocalan stands for something worthier than himself. But just look at the demonstrators. They read a Turkish newspaper, called Free Agenda. Interviewed on CNN from Germany, they speak Turkish. Their own forcign-based television station uses mainly Turkish, and, where not, Iranian or Arabic. British viewers might be slightly puzzled to see the demonstrators, in their trainers, doing that rum line-dance: It is an Anatolian and Balkan one, and yet it is now supposed to represent Kurdish culture. So is the funny Geronimo ululation that they stage. Have you seen the fat ladies with beaded head-coverings going on hunger strike? You can bet that, cameras removed, they light up: I have not heard of a single one carrying on the hunger strike for more than a few hours. Kurds do not have a unified culture: they are pre-national. One authority claims that there are 28 different languages masquerading as a unified Kurdish tongue. If a Kurdistan were created, the main language, North Kirmanci, would have to be imposed by force. There is a further problem in that Turkey's Kurds are divided by religion. About a third of them are not Sunni but Alevi, a variant of Islam that is in some ways quite close to Christianity, in that 1 wine plays its part, while men and women are not segregated. These Alevi Kurds are concentrated in Zaza-speaking areas and do not seem to work well with the Sunnis from elsewhere. 
 
 It is, incidentally, just not true that you cannot buy Kurdish periodicals in Turkey , or listen to Kurdish music. The problem is that no one bothers to read the stuff, which is why those London demonstrators can be seen reading a Turkish newspaper. As time goes by, some sort of Kurdish culture may emerge, but the far greater likelihood, at least as far as the Kurds of Turkey are concemed, is further assimilation. This has already gone a long way . I do not understand why the Turkish foreign ministry does not parade to foreigners the endless numbers of Kurds who are in high places in politics, business, the army, and whose identification with the Turkish state is 100 per cent. 
 
 It is difficult to decide what Turkey should do about the Kurdish question. But -and it would have been a kindness on the part of Mr Pinter to recognise this- the Turks are good guys. Their state works quite well. Their capture of Ocalan has been elegant: no one killed, 'Kurds' attacking Greek embassies rather than Turkish ones. if you are a Turk, life can be on the hard side, but Turkey is the only state between Graz and Seoul that works in a civilised manner. The place has done quite well since it was established in 1922, after defeating Lloyd George (no one else ever managed that). The economy was about a third the size of Sweden's a quarter-century ago, and is now bigger than Sweden's; the men live out their three-score-and-ten instead of tuming up their toes, Soviet- fashion, at 50. With all her problems, modern Turkey has been rather a success story, and my own observation over the past four years shows that the large number of foreigners here have a great deal of affection and respect for the country. In fact I have never been in a country where foreigners are generally nice about the natives. 
 
 Turkey is full of character , and I have a lot of time for my students in particular. In a world of great confusion, it is a stable and increasingly prosperous place, and though the police do occasionally overdo things, this happens far less than it used to, and Turks are quite right to feel insulted when dubious figures from the Council of Europe want to butt in on the Ocalan trial. It is irresponsible of the Harold Pin- ters of this world to argue as they do about a place that they do not understand. Since the days of his blunders about the Sandinistas he seems to have forgotten nothing and learned nothing. There is a Kurdish cause, and various solutions to the problem could be aired; but they should not include any sympathy for Ocalan and the terrorists, and it is not up to English play- wrights to offer them any aid and comfort."

It is now observed that the terrorists both in Turkey and outside, especially in West European countries, are resorting to rioting and making threats that reflect their frustration over the process of disintegration of the terrorist organisation. 
 
 Turkey holds sufficient power and means to assure complete security and tranquility in its country. The terrorist organisation now appears to be trying to create a distorted picture of our country through insidious activities as seen last days in a treacherous manner. Also during recent years, the terrorist organisation made similar claims and threats, but as a result of the effective measures taken, it failed to reach its goal neither in our touristic regions and big cities or in any other place in the country. As a matter of fact, each time, terrorists have been captured and handed over to justice. Therefore, one should not give credit to terrorists' threats and propagandas. 
 
 The demonstrations made and publications issued by this terrorist organization targeting Turkey, constitute a blackmail against the rights and freedom of travel of European peoples. 
 
 What is regrettable is that some governments chose to remain as mere spectators and even take a condoning attitude with regard to this blackmail, instead of making effort to protect the rights of their citizens. 
 
 Yet, we believe that European rationalism and wisdom will prevail also in this case as in the past and our foreign visitors will continue to enjoy what we, as Turkey, offer them in terms of holiday and travel opportunities, without any regard to these empty and baseless blackmails."

In this connection, the G-8 urges the UN Secretary-General to invite the two sides in Cyprus to negotiations in the fall of 1999 and expresses the hope to have an outcome obtained until the OSCE Summit in November. Until this stage the two parties have engaged in numerous talks in order to reach a settlement in Cyprus. Acting with the advantage of international recognition, albeit unjustly acquired, the Greek Cypriot side has always been the party obstructing a settlement in these talks. All negotiations resulting in failure have served to aggravate the climate of mistrust, deepen division and at the same time to escalate tensions in Cyprus. The Greek Cypriot accession negotiations with the EU, and thus its integration with Greece, following the Luxembourg Summit, has invalidated the agreed parameters for the resolution of the Cyprus question, in particular the sovereign equality of the two sides.It has also upset the Turkish-Greek balance and created a deadlock in the negotiating process. In fact, exploiting the advantegous position provided by the EU, the Greek Cypriot side has continued with its policy of escalating tension by introducing sophisticated offensive arms systems to the island and constructing naval and air bases for the use of Greece. It has also extended support to PKK terrorism directed against Turkey. Furthermore, the Greek Cypriot side has with impunity even rejected the package of military measures presented by the UN Secretary General aimed at enhancing confidence in the buffer zone. Unless the parameters for a settlement are built on the realities of the island and the present environment of mistrust is eliminated, any new negotiating process will have no chance of success. In this context, the views and the confederation proposal of Mr. Denktaş, President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, are fully supported by Turkey in line with our everlasting solidarity with the Turkish Cypriot people. Currently, there exists two equal, sovereign and democratic states in Cyprus, representing the two peoples of the island. A settlement in Cyprus can be viable if it is achieved by the two states and not by third parties and if the balances between Turkey and Greece are maintained. What is required for that end is to make a correct diagnosis as to why no progress has been made in the negotiations in the past, and to pave the way for the establishment of the basis required for result-oriented negotiations, rather than forcing the two sides to negotiate under certain time limits. This requires the acknowledgement of the existence of the TRNC."

Ismail Cem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, paid an official visit to Iran on 12-13 February 2001, upon the invitation of his Iranian counterpart, H.E. Mr. Harrazi. 
 
 Apart from his official talks with Minister Harrazi, Minister Cem was also received by President Khatami, Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Kerrubi, and First Deputy President (equivalent of Prime Minister) Habibi, during his visit. 
 
 The visit took place within the context of annual exchange of visits at Foreign Minister level between two countries. Minister Cem's visit was preceded by the official visit of Minister Harrazi in January 2000. Turkey and Iran both attach importance to these reciprocal visits. 
 
 During Foreign Minister Cem's visit, the bilateral relations and all related issues between Turkey and Iran, as well as international and regional matters of common concern were discussed. Both sides agreed to increase their efforts to enhance all aspects of their bilateral relations and in this context; to continue exchanging high level visits. On the occasion of the visit, Foreign Minister Cem expressed that Turkey welcomed and followed with close interest the reform process initiated by President Khatami. 
 
 An important aspect of Turkish-Iranian relations, namely security, was discussed at some length. Turkish side reiterated the emphasis it placed on this vital issue between the two neighbouring countries. Iranian side stressed that it defined PKK as a ""terrorist organization"". In this connection, cooperation achieved through the Turkish-Iranian High Commission for Security and the Joint Security Committee was reviewed and both sides affirmed their political will for the continuation and further strengthening of this cooperation. 
 
 Minister Cem was also accompanied by a group of businessmen and journalists. During the visit, Minister Cem addressed a joint meeting of the businessmen from both countries in the Iranian Chamber of Commerce. The main discussion was on possibilities to enhance the economic cooperation and to increase the overall trade volume between the two countries, which did not reflect their real potential. It was noted that the Turkey-Iran natural gas pipeline, once functional in July 2001, would increase bilateral trade volume more than two-fold, to nearly US$ 1,7 billion. This would, however, increase the trade imbalance, already in favour of Iran 2-to-5, to more than 2-to-7. During the visit, decision was also taken to establish Turkish-Iranian Business Council. 
 
 Also during the visit, activities of both Joint Economic and Joint Transport Commissions were reviewed. Of particular note was the recent meeting of the Joint Transport Commission, which convened prior to Minister Cem's visit. The Commission's decision to reestablish the passenger train links between Istanbul-Tehran and Damascus-Tehran was welcomed. 
 
 On the cultural side, a Cultural Exchange Programme, covering the years 2001-2003 between Turkey and Iran was signed, which envisaged cultural activities in various fields to be organized in Turkey and Iran during the prescribed period."

First of all, I would like to ask you a question about Northern Iraq. Mesut Barzani, the leader of the Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, has had a series of harsh statements about Turkey in recent days. On some maps, Kirkuk-Mosul is shown as Kurdish land, some statements on the KDP website and finally official publications say, “If the Turkish army comes to Northern Iraq, this place will be their graveyard”, Ottoman examples are reminded. What will you say to all this?
 
 MINISTER: Of course, we have not yet been able to obtain official information on whether these are the official positions of the KDP or not. But I understand that this statement, which was published in the KDP's media organ, is probably being interpreted by the KDP now and it is said that there is a mistake in the translation. Therefore, they themselves admit that they may have used expressions that exceeded their purpose. But no matter what, we think that the Iraqi people should have a voice first and foremost about what will happen next in Iraq, and Turkey's basic principles regarding Iraq or all its neighbors or all its foreign policy have not changed at all. We always show our stance in favor of peace and cooperation. In addition, we always state the necessity of protecting the territorial integrity and independence of the countries in the region, and we follow a policy in this direction. But of course, here in Northern Iraq, if there is a social organization that has arisen from certain needs and there are political parties that organize it, they should not forget that Turkey always considers the whole of the Iraqi people to be authorized to make decisions about their future, and in Iraq there are no regional or regional or national organizations. So-called solutions covering a part of Iraq will never be the solutions that Turkey will accept. Even if there are such social organizations beyond that, it can never be raised to the level of a separate political organization. But again, these political parties should not forget that, As always, Turkey has never been behind anyone in helping all elements and groups of people in Northern Iraq, despite the authority vacuum and various impossibilities that have emerged in Northern Iraq. He did his best for their well-being. Therefore, some expressions that can be described as hostile towards Turkey are now accepted as expressions that go beyond their intent.
 
 QUESTION: Well, then it seems inevitable that there is tension in relations with the KDP. It is even said that this disturbs Washington, and that there are or will be some attempts to relieve this tension before a possible operation. Have there been any such initiatives from Washington to Ankara?
 
 MINISTER: Of course, within the framework of this strategic cooperation with the USA, we negotiate not only regional but all issues. In addition, our bilateral relations are so versatile that we also meet with them. Therefore, these issues are of course discussed and discussed with the USA. This should not mean that we have a special expectation from the USA. But if everyone living in the country of Iraq has certain thoughts about the future, then we will always support their thoughts in terms of the Iraqi people as a whole. Because the destiny of a country is determined by the people of that country. So there is nothing here. So there is no such thing as talking to the Americans about what should happen in Iraq. I'm trying to point it out. But of course we consult on regional issues.
 
 QUESTION: Well, if I remember correctly, Ambassador Uğur Ziyal, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is going to Washington. It's about you going to New York for the opening of the UN General Assembly in the middle of next month. Will you go from there to Washington? Will you have a contact with your American interlocutor? And all these, such repeated contacts, are the signs that the American operation is approaching?
 
 MINISTER: No. So I disagree with your last statement. Because the USA has not yet made a decision about what steps to take on regional issues. We want all the problems in the region to be resolved peacefully. In addition, we do not want anyone to harm their territorial integrity and independence, as I have just mentioned. Again, we look at the Iraq issue within this general framework. As I just mentioned, our strategic relations with the United States are within the framework of our partnership, and as you know, Turkey, the closest ally of the United States for years, is also in this region, and we always have political consultations within this framework. The delegation headed by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ziyal, discussed all political issues that can be addressed within the framework of this strategic cooperation. as well as making a routine visit to discuss all economic and political issues in our existing bilateral relations with the United States. So, you know, they come from there, and from there they go from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to our people. I will be in the USA within the framework of the UN General Assembly. Nothing has been finalized yet, but it is likely that the US Secretary of State, Mr. I will also have a meeting with Powell.
 
 QUESTION: Well, if you excuse me, I would like to go back to Northern Iraq again. The allegations that the Turkish soldiers will operate there and enter Mosul and Kirkuk are constantly being voiced by Barzani. Was Barzani somehow warned that he constantly brings such issues to the agenda in the wrong way? Or Barzani being summoned here these days, is that kind of thing in question? Because these are very dangerous issues.
 
 MINISTER: You know, they have representatives here as well. Necessary warnings have already been made.
 
 QUESTION: Well, I would like to continue on Iraq. Because this is probably the issue that interests us the most in foreign policy. Allegations and rumors that the American operation will be carried out in December, January, or February at the latest, so to speak, are running rampant. Are our preparations complete for all this? Now, against a wave of immigrants. Also, you say routine meetings again, but was there a request from the Americans during these meetings or before these meetings, sir?
 
 MINISTER: No, there is no demand. In fact, we do not expect such an operation. You know, all kinds of speculations are made on this subject, all kinds of opinions are expressed. But if you remember, we were exposed to such a wave of immigration in the past and in 1990. Of course, Turkey will never want any developments in the region that will turn everything upside down and drive people from their homes and places. But all kinds of important or sad, unexpected developments in the region are calculated by us and necessary precautions are taken. Let no one be in any doubt about it.
 
 QUESTION: I would like to ask one last question about Iraq. You recently went to Jordan. There you met with your Jordanian interlocutor. You met with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, albeit in a surprising way. Will such visits to the capitals of countries neighboring Iraq continue? Or is it a question of you going to Baghdad?
 
 MINISTER: I will not go to Baghdad, but not this weekend, I will go to Tehran next weekend. At the invitation of the Honorable Foreign Minister of Iran, my one-day working visit will be there.
 
 QUESTION: Is that a routine too, Mr. Minister?
 
 MINISTER: It is considered routine. Because a visit from us had to be made there by the way. And when I received such a kind and sincere invitation, I decided to go to Iran in order to further develop our good relations with our neighbors. A one-day study visit.
 
 QUESTION: You say routine. But often important issues come up. Well, let's shift the geography a little bit to the west. On relations with the EU, I think you will have a few visits there as well. Can you give us his information? Where are you going and what will be the main theme you will cover?
 
 MINISTER: There will be a working trip for a few days, which will take place in the first half of September. There, too, Brussels and Strasbourg are in the first place. And there, if possible, with the Prime Minister of Belgium, if possible, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, if it is not possible, then in Strasbourg, as you know, the European Parliament convenes there, the Commission works there, I will have meetings with the relevant and responsible persons of both the Commission and the Parliament. Our aim in this is as follows: Turkey has done very important work in the last period in order to improve EU relations and to take the steps in its National Program. Moreover, at a time when the political instability in Turkey was at its peak, the Turkish Grand National Assembly did this in a way that reflected the will of the Turkish people. And we even went beyond the timing in our National Program, you know. After that first package, we were able to enact the Job Security Law. Therefore, our expectation now is, of course, that parallel steps or similar steps will be taken by the EU. This, of course, is to get a negotiation schedule and to make a decision to start negotiation.
 
 QUESTION: But didn't the excitement fade a little in the Turkish public? In other words, when those EU laws came out, everyone was sleeping with EU laws. Now focusing more on the electoral process, alliances on the right and left, it seems as if the EU remained in the background. Or I don't have a tongue to say but it's almost forgotten?
 
 MINISTER: Of course, those who raised this issue to show off, and those who wanted to turn it into an ideology of new formations or new government proposals by creating a polarization in Turkish society, may have understood and forgotten the futility of this, but, in this regard, Turkey's rights and We, who are tasked with protecting their interests, have not forgotten. Therefore, since we were able to take these steps, we took the steps we needed to take. It is our duty to explain this to our interlocutors, thinking that the EU should approach Turkey within the framework of objective criteria and give Turkey a negotiation calendar before the end of this year.

Thereupon, NATO Council held consultations during the last two days, and these consultations are still ongoing.
 NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson has put forward a consensus proposal on the defense support that can be given to our country by NATO today. This proposal of the Secretary General is considered to constitute a good basis for ensuring consensus among the Allies. The reconciliation proposal links some priority planning work to a timetable that will result in earlier results.
 It is normal for NATO consultations on such critical issues to continue for some time in their own dynamic, with Allies expressing their views in this process. However, it is essential that a decision be taken by the Allies as a result of ongoing consultations. The point that should be emphasized here is that all Allies have confirmed without hesitation that they will fulfill their collective obligations for the defense of our country in the event of an attack on our country.
 Turkey expects a decision at the NATO Council to be taken on the basis of the Secretary General's proposal, within the framework of the consultation process that allows the Allies to be informed in detail about the risks that the developments related to the ongoing process in Iraq may cause for our country's security and the measures that can be taken against them."

In the Defense Planning Committee, the Allies reviewed NATO's defense measures to support Turkey. By deploying equipment such as AWACS and air defense missiles, NATO is currently acting to help defend Turkey against threats from Iraq and deter attack.Last night, in light of the evolving situation, the NATO Defense Planning Committee approved changes to strengthen the rules of engagement for NATO forces in Turkey. These rules will enable our forces to carry out their duties effectively, whatever the circumstances. NATO deployments are, in their nature, purely defensive measures, in sharp isolation from other military operations in the region. In the event of any attack on Turkey, NATO will fulfill its obligations under the Washington Treaty.In the challenging days and weeks ahead, NATO will continue to meet and act as the primary forum for transatlantic security consultations. There are many NATO Allies and Partner countries in the coalition that participated in the operation against Saddam Hussein's regime.

 QUESTION: There are some news in the press today. It is said that the American soldiers in Northern Iraq printed business cards in three colors that Ankara did not like very much and that Turkey was very uncomfortable with this. Do you have any information about this?
 
 ANSWER: There is. It is true. It has been brought to the attention of American authorities.
 
 QUESTION: At what level?
 
 ANSWER: I think it's at the General Manager level or something.
 
 QUESTION: Any information?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know. We also have information about the information in the press. It appears to be true, and this has been brought to the attention of American officials.
 
 QUESTION: Between what?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know, in what context it is brought to your attention.
 
 QUESTION: What happened to the opening of the USA?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know.
 
 QUESTION: Is it true that Osman Korutürk could not get an appointment with Bremer?
 
 ANSWER: Is it true that Osman Paksüt could not get an appointment with Bremer? I do not know. Let's ask him too. There he fulfills his duties as Ambassador. You know, in a briefing in the past, it was agreed in Washington, Ankara and Baghdad to strengthen contacts and coordination with the Americans, as you said. At the moment, I do not know how this turned into a strong elephant in practice, but such a political will was displayed. 
 
 QUESTION: Does it work?
 
 ANSWER: I hope it works. But I have to ask him again to what extent it works.
 
 QUESTION: El Hekim had a dinner last night. What happened at this meal? Is there any extra information other than what has been described? And al-Physician, of course, avoids openly saying to the cameras, ""We are against the Kurdish State""; The information we received is on the way that we conveyed this to you at the meeting. Did this satisfy us with regard to al-Hakim's contacts? Can you give some general information?
 
 ANSWER: It is difficult to give general information now. Because they also have contacts today. The Prime Minister will accept today. Therefore, it is difficult to give general information before they are completed. As you can see between the lines of yesterday's statement, they want to keep their options open. It seems so. You may remember that before the Saddam regime was overthrown, various meetings were held in London, Selahattin and Ankara as the opposition and decisions were taken. The documents were adopted. For example, in London they used the phrase ""Federal Regulation"". But they didn't make it clear what was meant here, of course. But again, it is understood that they agreed, that they said that what they thought was not a federation based on ethnicity. I can say this much as my first impression. 
 
 QUESTION: Did his attitude in internal contacts satisfy Ankara?
 
 ANSWER: I have nothing beyond what I have said.
 
 QUESTION: What is the approach to security?
 
 ANSWER: Iraqi Shiites? Did they declare that they wanted such help in terms of security? I have to ask this at his office. I was not present at the session where he was recommended. A friend of ours mentioned it. It could also be a possibility. There may be areas such as security force, police force creation, training. Things like that can happen, let me find out and I'll tell you.
 
 QUESTION: The Minister was talking about a press conference yesterday. Do you have any information about the content of this meeting?
 
 ANSWER: Is it about the Constitution? Let's learn about it too. A meeting about the Constitution. It is about the constitution of Iraq that our Minister talked about yesterday. He probably mentioned a scientific meeting, but let's see if we have more detailed information.
 
 QUESTION: Before Behram Salih's visit to Ankara, he made a statement to NTV. Here, too, he made statements that Kirkuk belongs to the Kurds, and that there will be a place called Kurdistan in the federal state to be established. Do you have any comments regarding this?
 
 ANSWER: As you asked, there are also statements that they are merging or separating. Now it goes like this: These two Iraqi parties will unite, separate, unite again. But the important thing is that they work here for the unity and integrity of Iraq. Since his statements about Kirkuk were also asked, it is clear what Kirkuk is. The biggest proof that this is what it is, is the reaction of all Iraqi groups, whether Arab, Assyrian or Turkmen, to the attempts to seize this land. We see that those who are in charge of providing security in the city give a very bad test. We see that those who claim to be the most democratic in Iraq do not tolerate even a demonstration. 
 
 QUESTION: In this context, are the American soldiers who printed business cards those who served in the Kirkuk region?
 
 ANSWER: I don't have that much detail.
 
 QUESTION: There were some news in the press today. It is stated in the news that Prime Minister Erdogan will suggest to President Bush to appoint a mediator on the Cyprus issue during his American visit, and that the name of US Secretary of State Powell is mentioned. Is there any information in this direction?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know about it. You can ask Namık Bey about him after this press conference, after my duty is over and my grace period begins. 
 
 QUESTION: Any progress on the loan provided by this America? It is stated that Mr. Prime Minister has a request to change the political conditions, is this true? Also, has there been a response in this direction?
 
 ANSWER: Again, I would like to use my right to refer to Mr. Namık.
 
 QUESTION: In the news from Washington, there are news that the USA is requesting collective permission for the planes that will pass through Turkey instead of asking for permission one by one. Do you have any information regarding this?
 
 ANSWER: Friends, there are various issues in the press today, this is the coming and going of American planes. I want to give some information about them. This is the first thing you asked. There is no information on this. I don't think such a thing is true. Currently, the Americans have those transits, the aspects that are discussed, spoken and discussed, mostly in the context of the operation in Iraq. Beyond that, you know, Grossman had come to Turkey at the time. He went not only to Turkey, but also to Brussels, NATO Headquarters and explained the general global strategy of the USA and its philosophy. After that, he traveled to various NATO countries and told them, including Turkey. No request was made in this context. So we were almost there that day, and now we are at that point. 
 
 As for the issues that have been written and drawn about Iraq specifically, you know, our Minister made a statement yesterday. Maybe a separate written statement will be made today about some details. I would like to say the following to complement them. Again, let me tell you some of the elements seen in the press, in a way, based on them or wanting to refer to them. Now, for example, the decree is hidden or not, or later abolished. This decree was declassified on November 13 when the Americans were allowed to.
 
 QUESTION: So after November 13, the Americans were allowed.
 
 ANSWER: Yes, and the request for its removal went from our Ministry, and it went well before November 13. The request to declassify the decree. In fact, you will remember that Minister Çavuşoğlu made a speech to the press on these issues on 24-25 June. That's what it says there, that's what I see. In the Anadolu Agency text dated 24 June:
 
 “Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah Gul said that, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 1483, countries that will assist in the restructuring of Iraq can take advantage of Turkey's opportunities if they wish. Upon the questions of the journalists, Gül noted that they signed a decree yesterday in the Council of Ministers regarding this issue. Pointing out, among other things, that there are some opportunities in the Constitution so that there is no opportunity for a bill, he said that these opportunities may be related to aid or the entry of foreign soldiers.”
 
 In other words, he said that there might be a military arrival all the way back on June 24. The Minister said that such a decree was issued, and he also said that it might be related to security. ""For the sake of security,"" he said.
 
 Third, the point that I will mention in connection with this, again today in some of our press organs, ""Decision No. 1483 is only about helping the Iraqi people."" However, in the introductory part of this, in the Preamble Section, for example, it says ""welcoming further the will of member-states"", ""welcoming the willingness of member states"", ""to contribute to stability and security in Iraq"", ""contributing to stability and security in Iraq"" “We welcome their requests on the road,” he says. How does this willingness and contribution go “by contributing personnel, equipment and other resources under the Authority”? Likewise, in the last article of the same decision numbered 1483, more precisely, in the penultimate transaction clause, 'calls upon member-states' “calls to member states”; and 'and international and regional organisations' refer to 'international and regional organisations'. In what direction? It calls “to contribute to implementation of this resolution”. So it's broader. I wanted to bring it to your attention.
 
 QUESTION: So is there a requirement?
 
 ANSWER: At the beginning, it accepts this decision under section 7 of the United Nations Act.
 
 QUESTION: Are there any requirements for 1483?
 
 ANSWER: ""This provides an opportunity, it provides a legal basis,"" said the Minister. Also, let me say this again. In connection with what you said, the legal experts of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Staff examined the constitutional and legal aspects of this issue in detail and expressed a common opinion. Therefore, jurists have come to this conclusion. I will say one more thing, friends. You know, it sometimes appears in the press – let me tell you this as my own personal observation - it is said that we learned from the American press, we saw it. As far as I know, this news first appeared in Hürriyet newspaper, in the Turkish press. It came out in its own dimensions. I don't know if our friend got an award for him, but he wrote it in time. Therefore, the news that it first appeared in foreign newspapers does not reflect that much truth.
 
 QUESTION: When we called you at the weekend, you denied these reports.
 
 ANSWER: What was the first version of it as you asked in the American press? It was the arrival of soldiers in Germany within the framework of America's global strategy. I was just saying what I said about his global strategy before I started these words about Grossman's arrival.
 
 More importantly, before the Americans benefited from the opportunities created by this Decree, the opportunities created by the Decree of the Council of Ministers you mentioned, and the opportunities created based on 1483, which I mentioned, other countries also benefited from these opportunities, our squares, and our bases. Among them, I can mention Hungary, Poland and Italy.
 
 QUESTION: Do you plan to open up possibilities in other areas as well?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know. 
 
 QUESTION: What did they use?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know what they used, but they took advantage of the opportunities created by that Decree.
 
 QUESTION: Did Hungary, Italy, and Poland use it for troop transit or for humanitarian aid?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know, we'll ask that too.
 
 QUESTION: Is it the same in this context?
 
 ANSWER: They are used in the same framework.
 
 QUESTION: Is it before November?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know the exact date. The date of our Ministry's request for the Decree to be declassified is long ago.
 
 QUESTION: When?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know.
 
 QUESTION: Did you say November?
 
 ANSWER: It was already up in November. on the 13th of November. Again, something extra. The legitimacy of the subject has been carefully examined. A joint study has been made. The reference to resolution 1511 is made because it confirms and reinforces 1483, that is, in that context.
 
 QUESTION: Who was it made with?
 
 ANSWER: They shared a common opinion, legal experts from the Foreign Affairs and General Staff. 
 
 QUESTION: How is the declassified decree used?
 
 ANSWER: I think Anadolu Agency announced it the other day. 
 
 QUESTION: Is it legally published in the Official Gazette?
 
 ANSWER: You will appreciate that I will not be able to give an answer to it right now.
 
 QUESTION: Due to the lawsuits filed in the Council of State, the relevant Decree of the Council of State was sent to .......... Is it correct?
 
 ANSWER: I don't think so. 
 
 QUESTION: Let's talk a little bit about Cyprus. A government was established in Cyprus and it was heavily composed of technocrats. How does Turkey view this? Did Turkey want this?
 
 Another question I have is that President Denktaş is coming before the MGK in the coming days, is there a program about him?
 
 ANSWER: I will answer these in the easy way. Now, there is already a congratulatory message from our Honorable Minister on how we greeted the government. To Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat and Mr. Serdar Denktaş. In his message, the Minister states that he is pleased to learn that the coalition government formed under the Presidency of Mr. Talat has started his duty. “Cyprus is our common national cause, which we are defending with conviction. Turkey shares the same goals with the TRNC in terms of reaching a permanent reconciliation and solution in Cyprus. In order to achieve these goals, we will need to intensify the joint efforts carried out so far under the leadership of TRNC President Rauf Denktaş, in cooperation with your government in the coming period.” ""Turkey's,
 
 QUESTION: Who will Denktaş meet with when he comes to Ankara?
 
 ANSWER: I don't have any information on that at the moment. There is currently no information about the program.
 
 QUESTION: Was it Turkey's wish that the government be composed of technocrats?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know at all. I do not think so. You yourself saw the efforts to form a government. It was transparent.
 
 QUESTION: Does Turkey think that all the negative or positive results after the meetings with al-Hakim will be supported by all the Shiites in Iraq? Does Turkey accept this as the issues that arise, the results of all the issues discussed, the views of all Iraqi Shiites? 
 
 This is the second one. It is known that there are oppositional approaches among the Shiites. Did Turkey welcome Al-Hakim as the representative of all Shiite groups?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, Turkey welcomed Mr. El Hekim as the head of its own organization and also as the Chairman of the Temporary Governing Council at the same time.
 
 Representatives of various groups from Iraq came to Turkey, you know. Our delegation went from here to there under the chairmanship of Ambassador Selim Karaosmanoğlu. He had contacts with various groups. We try to get everyone's opinion, to convey our views, and to be in contact with various segments.
 
 QUESTION: Statement from the US State Department. “Even though the PKK has changed its name and there are congresses, we still see it as a terrorist country,” Richard probably made this statement.
 
 ANSWER: They have already put it on their list.
 
 QUESTION: Therefore, Turkey's expectation was once the elimination of the terrorist presence in northern Iraq. Quite a while has passed. Even 4-5 months passed. Is there any movement on this issue, or any signal, something that the US has fulfilled its commitment? Especially after this statement.
 
 ANSWER: You know, there were meetings on this subject. There were joint talks. There are certain reconciliations or certain disclosures. Beyond that, I don't have up-to-date information at the moment. I will explain the latest situation, but it was already stated there that necessary action would be taken in this regard. 
 
 QUESTION: Is there an issue with Iran?
 
 ANSWER: I don't have an answer about Iran right now?
 
 QUESTION: When will Berham Salih arrive?
 
 ANSWER: Do we have a program? No, he didn't.
 
 QUESTION: Is the date he foresees in relations with Turkey-EU, May 2004 or December 2004?
 
 ANSWER: It's a process, you know. You know the general approach of Turkey. To take history by overcoming all obstacles and by doing all that is incumbent on him and showing what he has done. It's about Copenhagen. Therefore, at all times, all our efforts continue with the greatest care and enthusiasm. The political will is in that direction. Therefore, the aim is to make every effort to get a timely negotiation date.
 
 Dear friends, we have now come to the end of the meeting. Contrary to my expectations, the meeting took a long time. That's why I'll cut the last part short. We have been together for over 3.5 years. Some of you joined this whole time, some of you joined later, some of you were present before, during this information exchange with our Ministry. First of all, I would like to thank you all for your interest. Thank you for your friendship, for your friendship. x
 
 We have always tried to do our duty, being aware of the fact that you are also serving an important public service, enlightening the public. I tried to do so. Our Ministry is in the same consciousness and all our units are. Of course, this information flow was ensured to the extent possible. Sometimes not available. Sometimes there were disruptions or omissions. We have left these behind now, but our main main goal has always been to inform our press and the public about foreign policy issues as much as possible through the press.
 
 As I said, this is a measure of success, it may be difficult to measure, there may be some difficulties, impossibilities, some delays due to the nature of some issues, but I think we are doing our best. You all did your best. I think we had a productive 3-3.5 years with each other in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity. Therefore, I thank you both for this professional relationship and for your friendship and friendship. As a reward for these thanks, I would like to entrust you to a valuable friend of mine, or at least to entrust this contact and contacts, namely the issues of our Ministry with the press, to Mr. Namık. With these words, I say goodbye to you, too. I'm planning to go to Jordan at the end of the month. Of course, I expect you all there when I go, as a friend, You can come as a friend or as a member of the press, of course, if you want to show your press activities there. So I want to end my words. Thank you all and goodbye."
18/02/2004,2/18/2004,18 Şubat 2004 - DIŞİŞLERİ BAKANLIĞI SÖZCÜSÜ NAMIK TAN'IN HAFTALIK OLAĞAN BASIN TOPLANTISI,18 February 2004 - ORDINARY WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCE OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN SPEAKER NAMIK TAN,https://www.mfa.gov.tr/18-subat-2004---disisleri-bakanlici-sozcusu-namik-tan_in-haftalik-olacan-basin-toplantisi.tr.mfa,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,-,-,1,"Dear Friends, Welcome to our first press conference of the new term. I greet you with the warmest of feelings. From now on, we will work closely on the ground of mutual love and respect for a while. I see you as a family with all the members of our Information Department. I believe that the most important thing that strengthens and exalts the family is mutual love and respect. That's why I found it appropriate to underline the words love and respect. At this first press conference, my first request from you is that you carry the accreditation cards given to you by our Ministry in a visible way – as long as you are here. I want to say this one more time. We've said it before, but this time I'm asking.Having said this, I would like to inform you about two issues. As you know, on the suggestion of our Minister that the Iraqis injured in the suicide attacks against the PUK and KDP offices in Erbil on February 1, 2004 could be treated in our country, 7 injured persons from the PUK, together with their companions, were to be treated in Mardin on February 6, 2004, on a private plane chartered by our Ministry. They were brought to Ankara from Turkey. Thereupon, both PUK Secretary General Celal Talabani and KDP leader Mesut Barzani expressed their gratitude to our Minister for their closeness. Two of the injured people, after their first treatment, voluntarily went to Germany and Sweden to continue their treatment. His treatment continued in Numune and Ankara hospitals. It was learned yesterday that the treatment of three Iraqi wounded in the Emergency and Traffic Hospital has been completed and they can be sent to their countries. Necessary arrangements have been made by our Ministry for this purpose. The persons in question were transferred by plane from Ankara to Diyarbakır on 17 February. With the possibilities of the Diyarbakır Governor's Office, they arrived in Habur and returned to their country.Also yesterday, a new caravan consisting of 28 injured and their relatives, who were PUK and KDP members, was taken from Diyarbakir to Ankara by a private plane chartered by our Ministry. These people were transported from Habur to Diyarbakir by ambulances with the means of the governorships of our regional provinces this morning. All transportation and treatment expenses of Iraqis are covered by our Ministry.QUESTION: KYB among 28 people ..........ANSWER: I am not aware of any details other than what I have told you. It is what I am saying here. I will ask, I will tell you the details.The second point that I would like to emphasize as information: The plane carrying the EU Term President Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen and the next term President Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot and EU Commissioner Chris Patten, which formed the EU Troika, was on February 19, 2004, that is, tomorrow, in India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. After visiting Ankara Esenboğa Airport, there will be a technical stop for one hour at 15.15. On this occasion, Minister Çavuşoğlu will host the EU Troika at the Airport. The EU Troika will essentially make a periodic official visit to our country on 8 March. In this Turkey-EU Troika meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers, Turkey-EU relations and other international issues will be discussed.These are the things I want to announce to you. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.QUESTION: Yesterday, some statements of Faruk Logoğlu, our Ambassador to Washington, were reflected in the press. Negotiations were made regarding the easier use of this $8.5 billion loan. Can you give some information about this?ANSWER: Friends, on this subject, at this stage, I have nothing to say. However, I noted your question. I will inform you about this later.QUESTION: Yesterday, I think, a statement was sent to the press from the Turkmen authorities within the framework of an information note, and it is stated in this statement that Adnan Paçacı from the Iraqi Provisional Administration distributed the temporary basic law. Here, Turkmens are not authorized and a region in the form of Kurdistan is drawn. Do you have any information about it? Will you have a reaction to this information?ANSWER: Let me say a few things about this subject. As you know, by the end of this month, that is, until February 28, 2004, the preparation of the interim administration law in Iraq and its submission to the Coalition administration is foreseen, according to the political calendar. Studies on this subject continue. We also closely follow the developments and reflected news about the studies. It is envisaged that the future constitutional structure of Iraq will be prepared by an institution to be elected by popular vote next year. It would be very wrong to take the steps that will condition this work from the beginning. The preparation of the Interim Administration Law on the basis of the existing 18 provinces of Iraq and with a content that reinforces the unity of Iraq will be in the interest of all parts of Iraq.QUESTION: Can we get more information from you about the Minister's trip to Russia? What contacts are foreseen?ANSWER: Friends, this afternoon, a preparatory meeting will be held under the chairmanship of our Minister, and the program will be finalized with all its lines and elements. We will then send you a note. This note is ready. But if you allow, let's wait for this meeting, then we will send you the program with all the details, probably by e-mail and fax this afternoon. We'll also answer your questions.QUESTION: It was a question of Osman Korutürk going to Baghdad. Any progress on this?ANSWER: I have no information on this subject, but I will ask and I will answer you Bahadır.QUESTION: Negotiations in Cyprus will start tomorrow and when will the delegation from Turkey leave? Who is it made up of? Also, if any result is reached in Cyprus, if a positive decision is made in the referendum, will the parliament or the TGNA make the final decision in Cyprus?ANSWER: Yesterday, we gave you some information about our officials who will go there, regarding your questions. These appeared in the press today. Beyond that, there isn't much to say. Those elements were already given to you by us as a ""background"" somewhere. But I request you to save the second part of your question for this afternoon. Two of our senior officials will give you a ""background"" briefing on this subject, as we have informed you before. There, you can direct all your questions to them within the framework you want.QUESTION: The delegations are leaving tomorrow, right?ANSWER: Yes.QUESTION: There were also contacts with the Georgian Foreign Minister yesterday. I know a new oil pipeline is on the agenda here. Can you give some information about this?ANSWER: Yes. At the joint press conference held there afterwards, you also listened, Mr. Japaridze, the oil coming from Novorossisk to be downloaded to Supsa via a new pipeline and from there to the Ceyhan terminal via a new pipeline parallel to Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC). He stated that they discussed the issue with Russia at the highest level and that they decided to form a joint working group on this issue. Minister Çavuşoğlu emphasized that Turkey would welcome such a project that would ease the Turkish Straits. Other than that, I don't have much information at this stage.QUESTION: If I am not mistaken, there was such a statement by the Minister, that the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline has the capacity to carry the oil that will come from here. Not the second pipeline, but will it be in the direction of transporting Russian oil from Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, or will it be a separate pipeline?ANSWER: I just said it. There is a new pipeline parallel to BTC, my understanding. So it's probably a new pipeline being said there. Not increasing the capacity of the existing pipeline. This is my understanding.QUESTION: An agreement for 18 provinces was signed, on November 15, between Talabani and Bremer. We, as I understand it, were welcoming to this agreement. So on this Interim Administration Act, will he ask the administration or the administration in Iraq or the United States to put this agreement into effect more effectively? Will there be any initiative in this regard?ANSWER: If you see fit, I would like to stay within the framework of the answers I gave at this stage. I will learn and tell you the other elements later.QUESTION: You will say, “Wait until the afternoon”, but there are many statements that Mr. Denktaş is worried. Especially about Ankara. Can I get a comment on this? Angela Merkel was also in Ankara. The certain discourses that took place during the Customs Union period began to be spoken openly, this time again. Apart from Merkel, do you have such a concern in Europe? Can I have your reaction?ANSWER: Regarding the first question, I again ask you to be patient.The second question is that Turkey already has a special relationship with the EU with the 1963 Ankara Agreement. Turkey-EU relations, as in relations with all other candidate countries, are not carried out verbally, but based on written documents within the framework of EU decisions, Accession Partnership Documents, National Programs and progress reports that are a part of the EU acquis. The rules of this process are clear. At the end of 2004, following the EU Commission's report stating that Turkey fulfills the political criteria, it will start negotiations with Turkey with the decisions to be taken at the EU summit. The duration of the negotiations will depend on Turkey's performance. As such, from now on, an institution such as a special status for Turkey cannot exist among EU rules.Dear friends, I understand that you have no further questions. I thank you all with the warmest feelings. From now on, we will work closely together. I am sure that you will reflect the feelings of cooperation, warmth, love and respect to me exactly as you always have. Thank you again."

As always, I greet you all with love.We have a statement today. Regarding the visit of Ms. Delia Domingo Albert, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, to our country. Ms. Delia Domingo Albert, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines, will pay a working visit to our country on 10-12 March 2004, upon the invitation of our Minister.Within the framework of the visit, in the meetings to be held between the delegations headed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, the possibilities of developing bilateral relations between Turkey and the Philippines will be emphasized, and views will be exchanged on regional and international issues of interest to both countries.In addition to this, I would like to express a couple of points regarding this visit. This will be the first visit of a Philippine Foreign Minister to Turkey. Maybe you will remember, in 1991 the Philippines opened a representative office here. In 1990, we opened our Embassy in Manila. In retrospect, the current President visited Turkey in 2000, but at that time he was the Deputy Head of State and Minister of Social Welfare and Development. Therefore, he visited our country in his capacity. In 1999, the President of the time, Mr. Süleyman Demirel, visited the Philippines. There is a regular political consultation mechanism between our ministries. We cooperate in the United Nations, International Organizations. As you know, the Philippines has been elected to the UNSC Temporary Membership since January 1, 2004.That's all I'm going to say. If you have questions, I'll try to answer them.------------QUESTION: What is Neuman's program? What will be discussed in the talks? Is it possible for you to briefly mention the main titles?Secondly, what is the last point reached in Cyprus as of today? I think the give-and-take process will start tomorrow. Could you give some details about this?QUESTION: It is stated that Karamanlis will attempt to postpone the quadrilateral conference between March 22-29 by one week. How does Turkey look at such a thing, does it look warmly? Is there such a possibility?ANSWER: Let's start with the first question. Ronald Neuman is the CPA's foreign director. His visit here—I'll say this as background if you'll excuse me—was originally planned. However, after the phone call of Minister Çavuşoğlu, he was given a duty to inform us about the temporary administrative law. He came here yesterday, you know. A working dinner was given to him by our Deputy Undersecretary Ambassador Alev Kılıç last night. Today, meetings between delegations are held. It started at 09:30 in the morning. DEİK will have a lunch at 13.00. Then, technical meetings will be held at the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade. Afterwards, he will have a meeting with Ambassador Osman Korutürk -around 3 pm-. Tomorrow (March 11), the meetings at the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade will continue. He will leave our country on the morning of March 12. The program is basically like this. Of course, you will appreciate it, it will deal more with economic issues. He will discuss these issues with his opponents here. However, in the meeting they will have with Ambassador Osman Korutürk, he will inform us about the temporary administrative law.There was a question about the stage reached in the Cyprus negotiations. You know, three weeks have passed in Cyprus. We have three more weeks ahead of us. It has become clear that the Greek Cypriot side has no political will and desire for a solution. They seem to be in the comfort of May 1 EU membership. They rejected all of the limited and reasonable proposals of the Turkish side without discussion. They also made some suggestions that go beyond the basic philosophy and parameters of the Annan plan and aim to change the plan in almost all aspects. Negotiations will be suspended tomorrow. During this time, the UN will evaluate the give-and-take process. Mr. Talat and Mr. Serdar Denktaş will come to Ankara this evening and the stage of the negotiations will be evaluated in all its aspects. That's all I'm going to say about it.I don't have any information about the last question, Gülsen's question.QUESTION: What time do Talat and Serdar Denktaş arrive?ANSWER: I don't know the details of their schedule yet, but as far as I know, they will arrive in the evening and will leave tomorrow afternoon.QUESTION: Who will they meet here?ANSWER: I am not in a position to say anything about those issues yet.QUESTION: It was said that there will be a break tomorrow. How long will this break take?ANSWER: As I understand it, there will be one day.QUESTION: Can you give us a little more information on what exactly will happen during the buy-and-give process? Because –it could be off the record – what exactly is meant? Will De Soto prepare a ruler or work on the items?QUESTION: It could also be the background. The Greeks rejected all proposals. Our people presented the text, and the Greeks rejected it, saying it was outside the Annan plan. The papers brought by the Greeks might have resulted, in the eyes of the Turkish side. So now the two sides are apart from each other as ………, so there is no intersection point. What will they take? As long as there are documents they can't agree on? Can you unpack this a little? Or will De Soto say, “You will put these on the table, you will put that on the table”? What is it exactly?ANSWER: Now, friends, I fully appreciate your desire to learn more about these issues, but what I can say must remain within this framework. Other than that, it wouldn't be right for me to say anything at this stage.QUESTION: Are Talat and Denktash coming as guests of the Turkish government, did we invite them?ANSWER: Probably so, I don't know. I have no idea about it.QUESTION: In this case, can a more active contribution be requested from the USA or the EU, is there any such expectation?ANSWER: Actually, my answer to this has to remain within the same framework, but maybe we can say this: There is the issue of making the agreement to be reached as a result of Cyprus negotiations as the primary law of the EU. We conveyed our legitimate concerns and views on this issue to the EU officials during the Troika meeting held the previous day. The EU stated that it continues its technical and legal work on this issue. We suggested that EU lawyers and our lawyers come together and discuss this issue. Lawyers will meet in Turkey in the coming days. We have not yet determined the time and schedule for this. I will pass it on to you as information becomes available.QUESTION: I would like to return to Iraq and the provisional administrative law. In a statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday, Turkey's discomfort regarding the temporary administrative law was conveyed. Then, similar statements were used in the Council of Ministers. However, the text was signed on Monday. Your reactions to this will probably be conveyed again, but what is your reaction to the official signing?ANSWER: It is not possible for me to interpret the statements of the Minister. I told you about our approach. Therefore, I believe that it would be better not to say anything further than that.QUESTION: Has it been finalized where the four-way conference will be held?ANSWER: No, not yet.QUESTION: There are some expressions in the Turkish press today, referring to a Western diplomat. It is said that if or if there is a division within the terrorist organization, it will change the nature of the struggle. How does Turkey respond to this, how does it view this evaluation?ANSWER: We do not have any information about the news that has been claimed in that direction. I can say it.QUESTION: During the restructuring process of Iraq, many evaluations were made whether or not the United States would give tenders for certain commercial areas to Turkey and companies of Turkish origin. But today, we learned in the news that he tendered an oil production agreement worth 100 million dollars to Turkish companies. Have your approaches on this matter yielded results?ANSWER: I read it from the press too. I do not have detailed information about it. If you allow, I will deal with it with our relevant Department and give you more reliable information.QUESTION: Can you give us a calendar for the minister's trips abroad this month or next month?ANSWER: I will. Not next month, but I can give you an idea about this month. But if you find it appropriate, if you call us, I will tell you what kind of visits they have.QUESTION: Can we get a background for the Iraqi interim administrative law?ANSWER: I'll look at it, I guess it will.QUESTION: That Neuman's airtime will be tomorrow, not today....ANSWER: It's on my schedule today.QUESTION: Is he meeting with the General Staff?ANSWER: There is no such thing in the program.Guys, I understand that there are no more questions. Thank you very much, I greet you all again with love."

I greet you all with love as always. I have nothing to explain to you. So if you have questions, I'll try to answer them.
 
 QUESTION: Some news came from the USA. In New York, a group of American police, the secret service, was raiding a number of Turkish shops. Raids are happening in series. Any information on this? If so, does it have a political side? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't have any information on this subject, but if I get information, I will let you know.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, I think a visit is expected from Israel. Deputy Prime Minister of Israel. Has its history been clarified? What will happen in the talks? Who are you in talks with? Can you give us some information about the program?
 
 ANSWER: Yes. Evud Olmert, Senior Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Trade, Labor and Communications of Israel. He is expected to come to our country on the evening of 13 July to attend the Joint Economic Commission (KEK) meeting, the first of which was held in 2000. The technical meetings, in which economic and commercial issues will be discussed, are planned to be held on 14-15 July under the coordination of the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade. Israeli Senior Deputy Prime Minister Olmert will be accompanied by a number of businessmen during his visit. It is envisaged that the Turkish side will be chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Sami Güçlü, at the JEC meeting. Details of the program have not yet been created. These are being worked on. I will inform you about the details of the program in the coming days.
 
 QUESTION: Is there a modernization of the Undersecretariat of Defense Industries regarding the M-60 tanks among the topics studied for the Israeli Minister's visit? You said that the Minister of Agriculture will be the head of the Turkish delegation regarding the Southeastern Anatolia Project. Does it have a connection with it? Is there a connection between the Minister of Agriculture's presiding over the Turkish delegation, the Southeastern Anatolia Project and Israel's interest?
 
 ANSWER: It is the Joint Economic Commission Meeting to be held. As I have just stated, I do not know its agenda and what issues will be discussed. I will research these in the coming days and give you information about the agenda. In this context, I will also tell you whether there are any of the issues you mentioned.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, there are some statements from Kurdish leaders regarding the status of Kirkuk. Especially from Barzani. Can we get the evaluation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: The final status of Kirkuk has not been determined yet. However, there are clear historical facts. In this framework, Kirkuk has been a city inhabited by various ethnic groups. The point to be noted here is that no attempt is made to change the demographic structure of the city and that the ethnic groups in question live together in peace, tranquility and security in the city. This will also form the basis of Kirkuk's future status. Everyone knows that various groups in Iraq have sensitivity on this issue. In addition, both the countries neighboring Iraq and the international community have sensitivities about the special status of Kirkuk. These sensitivities arise from the vital connection of the issue with the stability, peace, prosperity and balances of the region. Therefore, The final status of Kirkuk should reflect all these expectations and at the same time form the basis for Iraq to gain the identity of an exemplary country in peace, prosperity and stability with itself, its neighbors and the international community, as everyone desires. This is the reality that Turkey emphasizes. 
 
 QUESTION: Turkey had an invitation to Iyad Allawi. Has there been a response to this invitation? When will this visit take place?
 
 ANSWER: We sent the invitation. Work continues on reaching an agreement on a date.
 
 QUESTION: We agreed in principle, right?
 
 ANSWER: Yes.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, there was a conflict with the PKK in Iran. Is this within the knowledge of Turkey? Any other information coming? Also, is it planned to do anything comprehensive against the organization?
 
 ANSWER: There is no information in the press today or about the mentioned conflict that has been submitted to our Ministry. Before our Prime Minister's visit to Iran, the Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee Meeting will be held in Ankara next week. At this meeting, we expect the Iranian authorities to inform us in detail about these conflicts and their work in the fight against terrorism.
 
 QUESTION: Is Talabani's visit to Istanbul reflected in the press within the knowledge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Moreover, it is claimed that the vehicle used by Talabani belongs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Do you know about this?
 
 ANSWER: Yes, I saw that news. We are looking at him. I will inform you about that later.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, they have just given me the news. The European Commission has approved the package regarding the opening towards Northern Cyprus. I think you are familiar with its content. If you give us a reaction of Ankara regarding its content.
 
 ANSWER: Regarding the subject, the studies on the regulations carried out by the EU continue. As a result of these studies, a meeting of the commissioners will be held today. After the meeting in question, Commissioner Verheugen is expected to make a statement. Qualified majority of votes are required in order for the text announced at the end of the meeting to be accepted. At this stage, it is envisaged that the text will be explained and the attitudes of the countries on this issue will be awaited, and that the issue will be evaluated by us later on.
 
 QUESTION: In the news in Moscow today, there were some news about the smuggling of tanks and weapons to Turkey. Do you have such information? Did Moscow ask Ankara for information on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: Our Ministry has not received any official information on this issue either. The subject is being investigated.
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that the Syrian Prime Minister is expected to come to Turkey with a sudden request within the next week. Any info on that? Also, I think it is envisaged that the long-debated summit to be held in Egypt will be held around the 20th-21st of the month. Can you give me information about this?
 
 ANSWER: It is true. The Syrian Prime Minister will visit our country next week. Likewise, on the date you specified, Countries Neighboring Iraq VII. The meeting will be held in Cairo. 
 
 QUESTION: A Meeting of Countries Neighboring Iraq will be held. Did you date him?
 
 ANSWER: I remember 20-21. We confirm it. My friends confirm to you. 
 
 QUESTION: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stated that he has good relations with Talabani and Barzani. In addition, the former commander of Abu Ghraib stated that the Israelis were doing intelligence work in Iraq. Does this work of Israel in Iraq disturb the Turkish Foreign Ministry? 
 
 ANSWER: We made the necessary explanations on these issues before the NATO meeting. Therefore, I have nothing to add to these.
 
 QUESTION: Turkish Airlines will renew its fleet. New aircraft will be purchased and the news reflected in the press stated that the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be sought, especially in terms of foreign policy, in these purchases. Was there any request for opinion from the Ministry regarding these purchases from Turkish Airlines?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information in this direction. I will ask this to the relevant Department.
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that the PUK's Regional Prime Minister, Barham Salih, will not be able to appoint a new Prime Minister to replace Barham Salih, after he has been appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq. The reason is that they are working on joint management with the PUK. Do you have an opinion to tell us about this?
 
 No answer.
 
 QUESTION: In accordance with the decision taken by NATO, the relevant countries would carry out a number of studies on the training of Iraqi soldiers, either internally or externally. A team from NATO is currently meeting with Iraqi officials. Allawi also has statements that it would be inconvenient for Turkish soldiers to be in Iraq, even for training. Have we done any study? How do we evaluate the subject of Allah?
 
 ANSWER: Again, if you allow me, let me say a few things as a background. You know, the modalities of the decision taken at the NATO meeting have not been determined yet. As far as I know, the NATO Secretariat has been assigned to this issue. NATO Secretariat will work with the Iraqi interim administration. It will determine Iraq's management needs. After that, it will make a planning study and present it to the member states. Member countries will thus learn the modalities of this work. To what extent they will contribute/not contribute with their means will decide. It hasn't reached that stage yet. 
 
 QUESTION: The Minister also had statements during the NATO summit. He said this. “We look forward to education in Turkey. Turkish soldiers do not necessarily have to go to Iraq.” Is there any change in this regard? Or is this view still valid in the Ministry?
 
 ANSWER: There has been no development since that opinion was expressed by our Honorable Minister.
 
 Thank you very much to all of you. So we close our press conference."

 Dear Friends, welcome to our press briefing today. I greet you with love. Before that, I made a suggestion to you on an important issue – I won't say a warning, but – on various occasions. That's where you put on your accreditation cards. During the visits made here yesterday, we observed that many of our friends who were not accredited to our Ministry were in front of the Ministry. You've seen this too. This creates a serious security problem. Therefore, in our next briefing, if you do not have your press accreditation cards on, we will not have to admit you here. I would like to remind you of this issue and request you to pay attention to it.
 I don't have any explanation. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.

 QUESTION: In his speech yesterday, Celal Talabani stated that there are many forms of federation in front of them and that they will choose one by drawing their own framework. In other words, they started to show their clear stance on the federation. At this point, is Turkey still against the concept of federation or does it not look forward to a federation that will only give autonomy to the Kurds?
 ANSWER: What matters to us is the territorial integrity of Iraq. This issue is also emphasized in UN Security Council resolutions. The way to do this is through the agreement of the Iraqis. Reconciliation is the Iraqis' own business. If a consensus cannot be formed and this leads to an internal conflict, then regional countries and the international community have a say. Our views within this framework are constantly being processed by all Iraqi authorities. It is known that there is a consensus in the international community on this issue. As a matter of fact, this constitutes the basis of the meetings of the countries neighboring Iraq. It is essential that the security problems in Iraq be resolved as soon as possible. It is our greatest wish that peace and tranquility will prevail in the country as soon as possible.
 QUESTION: Israel-Turkey relations are on the agenda again with the allegations that Israel allows the Kurds, and if I am not mistaken, Israeli Foreign Minister Mr. Shalom had a sentence yesterday against Prime Minister Mr. Erdogan like “How long can we remain silent about Turkey's overt criticisms”. In the light of this last statement, do you have anything to say about Turkish-Israeli relations?
 ANSWER: We followed the statements of the Israeli Foreign Minister from the press. That's all I'm going to say.
 QUESTION: After the article in the New Yorker, some newspapers today have some information about Israel's presence in Northern Iraq. That the Jewish Kurds bought land there. Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul had previously said that there were information and sensations that came to them in this direction. Any information on this? That Israel or Jewish Kurds bought land there. Also, was the breakfast that Ertuğrul Özkök stated in his column made? At that breakfast, were there messages related to Israel or Northern Iraq, as Ertuğrul Özkök said? Could you give a little more detail about this breakfast? You were also found.
 ANSWER: Let's start with your first question, Minister Çavuşoğlu made statements to all of you on various occasions yesterday. There is nothing to add to them.
 The breakfast is correct, it has been made. Seymour Hersh is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist worldwide. He requested such a meeting and within this framework, a meeting was held with him by arranging breakfast.
 QUESTION: Could you give some information about Bush's visit to Ankara? What topics will be discussed and if there is a clear program, can we get it too?
 ANSWER: As of the date of US President Bush's Ankara visit, you all know. It is not possible for me to go into the details of this in terms of the program. You know why this happens too, it's a safety issue. Naturally, all kinds of issues that primarily concern Turkish-American relations will be discussed with him. Meanwhile, international and regional issues will be discussed. It wouldn't be right for me to count them one by one. Because they are all very comprehensive. Necessary evaluations will be made on these issues at the highest level.
 QUESTION: Was information requested from the USA regarding the Turkish truck and truck driver scanned last week? Any info at least? There are also allegations in the press that American soldiers were drunk. Does it match your information?
 ANSWER: It is true that this event happened. In this context, various expressions have emerged. We are closely following what is going on both in Ankara and Iraq. We are meeting with the stakeholders. Naturally, this includes officials from the American Embassy in Ankara. We think it's in everyone's interest that the facts come out on this matter.
 QUESTION: Do you have any comments on the Council of Europe's removal of Turkey from the inspection process?
 ANSWER: Yesterday we made that assessment in the form of a statement. So I'm going to ask you to take a look at it.
 Well, thank you all so much."
28/06/2004,6/28/2004,28 Temmuz 2004 - Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Namık Tan´ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı,"July 28, 2004 - Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Namık Tan",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/28-temmuz-2004---disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-namik-tan_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi.tr.mfa,,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,PKK,0,0,"TAN: Dear friends, I welcome you to our press briefing today, and I greet you all with love. I will not have any explanation or anything to point out. As such, if you have any questions, I'll try to answer them. 
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, some claims of the Greek Cypriot side appeared in the Turkish press today. That the berthing and anchoring ban imposed on Greek ships since 1974 will no longer be enforced, and that even one or two ships docked at an unnamed Turkish port. Likewise, there is a claim in the Greek Cypriot side that air corridors will also be opened. Is there any development in this direction that you can inform us about? Did the Greek Cypriots make such a request? For example, opening the air corridor or providing transportation to other countries via Turkey. 
 
 ANSWER: My dear friends, the Greek Cypriot side, who said no to the Annan Plan in the referendums, put forward suggestions that cannot be implemented from time to time and make attempts before various countries and organizations in order to counter the criticism and reactions that have arisen against it in the international arena. The news in question and the issues you have mentioned are the manifestations of these efforts. At the moment, the most important issue for Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots is to lift the embargoes that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is exposed to and to break the isolation. I recommend that you do not rely on news and information beyond these. 
 
 QUESTION: Sir, what I understand from what you have said is that the Greek Cypriot side came up with such proposals, but it was not acceptable to us. Did I misunderstand? 
 
 ANSWER: You misunderstand. I didn't mention us. 
 
 QUESTION: Because you said you came with some suggestions. It doesn't necessarily have to be us. It can also happen in various countries. 
 
 ANSWER: I said, “Sometimes, suggestions that cannot be implemented are put forward.” They do this in the presence of various countries and organizations. 
 
 QUESTION: There are news in the media today that the US raided an office affiliated with the PKK and arrested some people. Have you received any information on this subject? 
 
 ANSWER: There is no information that has reached us on this subject. However, we are investigating the issue. 
 
 QUESTION: A follow-up question to the first question. You said suggestions that were impossible to implement. Does Turkey see the demands of the Greek Cypriot side within the framework of the Customs Union as demands that cannot be implemented? 
 
 ANSWER: I said that I would tell you about this subject. Beyond that, I have nothing to say. 
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, based on Greek media sources, it was stated that the Netherlands, the EU Term President, will reveal a solution plan calendar for reunification in September. Is there any information that has reached Ankara on this subject? How would the Turkish side approach such a development? 
 
 ANSWER: This issue should be evaluated within the same framework. As a matter of fact, when you look at all these news, you know very well, you will see that they are all of Greek origin. 
 
 QUESTION: There was another news in the Greek Cypriot press. A Turkish newspaper reports this to us. The Greek media argued that Turkey had promised to withdraw troops from Cyprus in the autumn as a sign of goodwill. What would you say about this? 
 
 ANSWER: I just gave my assessment about the Greek Cypriot press. 
 
 QUESTION: There have been reports that America wants to shift its F16s from Germany to Incirlik. Is there any official progress on this issue? 
 
 ANSWER: I can say this. There has been no development that will change the statements we have made on this matter or the information we have given before. 
 
 QUESTION: As it is known, there would be consultation on this issue. America says it's about to make its decision on the matter. Is a visit planned? 
 
 ANSWER: I am not aware of such a visit. We'll see. 
 
 QUESTION: There are a few issues related to Iraq. The first would be a visit from Iyad Allavi. It didn't come true. There are comments that this is a reaction to Turkey. There are comments that Iyad Allavi distanced himself from Turkey. Secondly, we wanted to open a Consulate in Mosul, is there any progress on this issue? Finally, there is a statement by Barham Salih that has reached you: “Kurdish Peshmerga will not be dispersed. Just as we do not interfere in Turkey's internal affairs, we do not want our neighbors to interfere in our internal affairs. Can we get your evaluations on these? 
 
 ANSWER: Let me try to answer them in order. Some news appeared in the press that Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allavi did not want to come to Turkey. These are in no way true. He was invited. He also wishes to come here. The visit is planned to take place on a date to be determined after the holiday period. The second is the Consulate issue in Mosul. Yes, the news about it is true. We already had a Consulate General in Mosul. We are in contact with the Iraqi Interim Administration to activate this Consulate General again. It is a process. Necessary steps will be taken as a result of that process. Your third question, I saw the statements of Barham Salih in the press. However, I have not been able to evaluate it in detail. We'll see him later. 
 
 QUESTION: When you put all these together, do you think it is correct to interpret that the new administration of Iraq is very distant towards Turkey? They want to put a distance between them and Turkey is trying to get closer. Iraq's comments on this approach are negative. How do you evaluate all this? There is a generally negative atmosphere in the developments. 
 
 ANSWER: That would be entirely your interpretation. 
 
 QUESTION: Did we receive a negative response to our request to open a consulate? Or do you justify their efforts to open it? 
 
 ANSWER: If there is any misunderstanding, let me correct it. I confirm the activities on opening a consulate. It's not like we got a negative response. 
 
 QUESTION: Have you received any information about the new Iraqi Ambassador to Ankara? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know anything about that. This morning I posed a question or two to my friends about this. However, I did not get the answer. When I get information, I will inform you about it. 
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, it is claimed that the Greek Cypriot Minister of Commerce came to Turkey last week and met with Turkish officials. Do you confirm such a visit and talks? 
 
 Answer is no. I am not aware of such a visit. 
 
 QUESTION: During the Prime Minister's visit to Iran, there is a news that if the PKK/KONGRA-GEL is recognized by Iran, the Turkish authorities will also recognize the People's Mujahideen Organization. Is something like this expected? 
 
 ANSWER: Friends, please do not expect me to comment on the unfinished visit of our Prime Minister, referring to the press reports. 
 
 QUESTION: Sudanese Foreign Minister was here. At the press conference he held yesterday, he gave the message that, upon one of our questions, Turkey is willing to mediate between the US and Sudan on the Darfur issue. He said that Turkey could help them because the USA is a friendly and ally country. Do they have such a proposal to Turkey, such as a mediation proposal? If so, how does Turkey view it? Will he take on any role? 
 
 ANSWER: Regardless of the statements of the Minister, let me give you a brief information. The Permanent Representatives of the member states of the Islamic Conference to the UN held a meeting in New York on 12 July to discuss the developments in Darfur. In this meeting, it was seen that there was a consensus in the opinion that the Organization of African Unity carried out some activities to solve the problem and that this Organization should be given time to get results. As the OIC troika, the Permanent Representatives of Turkey, Iran and Yemen announced this opinion with a written note to the President of the UN Security Council on 15 July, stating that they expected the Security Council to support the African Union and to allow the Union's efforts to yield results. . 
 
 QUESTION: It is stated that the Syrian intelligence units sent a report to Turkey and in this report, about 10 thousand Jewish settlers bought land in Kirkuk and Mosul. What is your comment on this? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know anything about it. 
 
 I guess you have no further questions. Our meeting is over here. 
 
 QUESTION: Will press conferences be suspended? We are entering the holiday season. 
 
 ANSWER: It depends on your request. You are right, there will be some slowdown in our tempo due to the holiday period of August. If you wish, we can take a break of at least two weeks. After that, if we see it necessary, we will start, if we do not see it, we will extend the holiday for one or two more weeks. If you also see fit, I assume that my proposal is accepted. 
 
 Thank you."

 The maintenance of peace, tranquility and security in Kirkuk, an Iraqi city where various ethnic and religious groups live together, is sensitive not only to Iraq's stability and internal balances, but also to the stability, peace and prosperity of the region. 
 
 Information on the situation in Kirkuk and our sensitivity on this issue were brought to the attention of PUK Leader Celal Talabani, who visited our country a while ago. Stating that he also spoke on behalf of other groups in northern Iraq, Mr. Talabani suggested that a delegation from Turkey visit the region to examine the situation in Kirkuk on the spot. In this context, a delegation headed by the Deputy Special Representative of our Ministry for Iraq and representatives of our relevant institutions and organizations visited Kirkuk on 6-11 July 2004. 
 
 Our delegation had extensive contacts with all segments of Kirkuk's people, without exception, as well as with the US and British diplomatic representations in the city. 
 
 Our delegation has determined that there are serious efforts to change the demographic structure in Kirkuk, supported by construction activities, and that many elements that make up the Iraqi people are uncomfortable and worried about this situation. 
 
 People who were forced to migrate from their places of residence during the old regime in Iraq have the right to return to their old places if they wish. However, it is believed that this should be done regularly, after the establishment of a permanent constitutional government in Iraq, in accordance with social consensus, in accordance with records and fairness, without resorting to discrimination and abuse, and that fait accomplis must be avoided in this sensitive period. The main criterion here is the incarnation of Iraq as a country at peace with its own people and the international community. 
 
 Turkey will continue to monitor the developments in Kirkuk carefully and closely, in consultation with neighboring countries, and will maintain its warnings before the Interim Iraqi Government, international and regional organizations and all relevant parties."

I greet you all with love. 
 
 Recently, we have seen some news that Turkmens and US soldiers clashed in the Telefar region of Iraq. According to the confirmed information and intelligence reaching our relevant military and civilian institutions from their sources in the region, the clashes between the insurgents of Muqtada al-Sadr and the American soldiers have spread to the Telafar region. Due to the fact that the majority of the population in the said region is Turkmen, Turkmen civilians also lost their lives in the conflicts. Therefore, the allegations of clashes between Turkmens and US soldiers, as reflected in some newspapers in recent days, do not reflect the truth. As a matter of fact, you will all remember that the Iraqi-Turkmen front also emphasized this issue in the statement made the previous day. 
 
 Other than that, there is nothing else I would like to mention. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them. 
 
 ........................... 
 
 
 QUESTION: Did you find any information regarding the migration of Turkmen from the conflict area to the same sources? (to the military and civilian resources you just mentioned) 
 
 ANSWER: I have told you the confirmed information that has reached our relevant authorities. Other than that, I don't know the details of the issue. 
 
 QUESTION: I want to ask a question about this. How did Turkmen civilians lose their lives, that is, were they caught in the conflict? Or is there some participation in Sadr's supporters, individually? 
 
 ANSWER: As you would appreciate, most of this information is intelligence and confidential information. So, I'm not graduated to tell you more about the details. 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, Talabani made a statement yesterday. If they change their route, they will be able to escort Turkish drivers. How does Ankara view this and will this be on the agenda in today's talks? Do we have a request for help from them, or will we take a step towards realizing their request in this direction? 
 
 ANSWER: We do not know what issues Talabani came here to discuss. In the meeting that will be held this afternoon, a number of issues will be discussed with him. If he brings it up himself or if our authorities deem it appropriate, these issues are also discussed. However, on this occasion, let me give you some information about Barzani's visit and Talabani's expected visit in the afternoon. 
 
 While Nechirvan Barzani was returning from Europe to Iraq, and Celal Talabani was on their way to Europe, while they were passing through Turkey, they wanted to meet with our authorities. In this framework, both of them will be accepted by our Honorable Minister. As you know, Minister Çavuşoğlu met with Nechirvan Barzani yesterday. Today, he will accept Jalal Talabani. Both officials convey the latest information about the current situation in Iraq first hand, convey their views and evaluations on the developments, and emphasize that Turkey is in the position to contribute the most to Iraq among the neighboring countries, and that it has been doing so. Likewise, both officials They express their desire to further increase the economic and commercial relations between Iraq and Turkey and state that they will do their part in this regard. After reaffirming our policies and approaches to Iraq, we explain our own observations and evaluations, and in this context, as always, we clearly state that the importance we attach to the unity of Iraq should be a representative democracy in all aspects. and that none of the groups that make up Iraq should feel excluded from this equation. We also underline the sensitivity of the Kirkuk issue. Same way, We also strongly emphasize the importance of not directing any terrorist threat from Iraq to our country, and in this context, the local groups do not support or contribute to the PKK's activities in the region. Our interlocutors, in their contacts with us, say that they are aware of our sensitivities and that they will act accordingly. These issues were discussed in general terms with Barzani yesterday. Today, it is foreseen that the issues will be discussed in the same framework as Talabani. 
 
 QUESTION: I think Barzani made a statement yesterday. It is stated that an airport in Northern Iraq will be operational soon and Turkish companies are also interested in organizing Charter Expeditions. Do you have any knowledge about this topic? 
 
 ANSWER: This issue was not brought up during his meeting with our Minister. These are their own expressions. Of course, if there are applications to our relevant authorities in the coming days and months, we will evaluate them. 
 
 QUESTION. Namık Bey, both Talabani and Nechirvan Barzani, although Nechirvan Barzani is not related to the central government, but Talabani, while making some promises to Turkey or making some evaluations, does the Government of the Republic of Turkey accept him as a representative of the central government? does it? Or, in his own words, does he accept it as a representative of the Kurdistan administration? Nechirvan Barzani has a different situation, I want you to answer it separately. Is Nechirvan Barzani considered a party leader? Or does the Government of the Republic of Turkey accept him as the prime minister of Iraq-Kurdistan? 
 
 ANSWER: If you expand your question a little more, I will try to answer it. I do not understand. 
 
 QUESTION: In what capacity does the Republic of Turkey accept Celal Talabani and Necirvan Barzani because they are here now? As party leaders, as the prime minister and rulers of Iraqi Kurdistan, or as members of the central government? 
 
 ANSWER: I can say this. It considers those who are members of the interim administration as members of the interim administration, and others as the leaders of certain political groups in Iraq. 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the agreement regarding this Mahmur camp was submitted to the parties for signature. What is the latest situation in this regard? In addition, America had demands for some changes to the agreement. What is Turkey's view on this issue? Are there any changes? What is the final point at this point? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know the latest developments on that subject. I need to know about these. If you'll excuse us, we'll take a look at them and give you an answer at once. 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I have two questions. One of them is your explanation for the Turkmen a little while ago. Now, as far as we know, no other ethnic group lives in Telefar. All the inhabitants are Turkmen. Therefore, the fact that the conflicts have spread to this point shows that this problem has increased regarding the Turks, to whom Turkey is sensitive. Has there been any contact with the Americans on this matter? Because if the conflicts increase there, even more Turkmen will die. My second question is about the Patriarchate. A demonstration was held in Istanbul. Will you have a reaction on this? 
 
 ANSWER: You will all remember how sensitive our Minister, our Ministry and other relevant institutions have shown to the Turkmen issue from the statements made by the most authoritative mouths on various occasions before. Therefore, I do not want to reiterate them. For Turkey, of course, the security, welfare, tranquility and peaceful coexistence of the Turkmen with other elements in the region are of great importance. We emphasize this sensitivity on every occasion. 
 
 Coming to your second question, we see that there have been efforts to reflect the demonstration held in front of the Fener Greek Patriarchate of Istanbul in recent days outside of its purpose and framework. On this occasion, I would like to emphasize that the Patriarchate, a Turkish institution, is under the guarantee of our laws and legal system. As a matter of fact, our security forces took all necessary precautions during the demonstration. It is in no way possible to approve of actions and behaviors that are incompatible with the framework stipulated by the laws or that exceed the legal limits. 
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, as far as we know, Osman Öcalan, who left the PKK, is stationed in the region dominated by Celal Talabani, who will meet with the minister today. In today's meeting, will you have some initiatives regarding the extradition of Osman Öcalan? Also, is there a message sent to Ankara from Kurdish groups to establish some relations between Osman Öcalan and Turkey? 
 
 ANSWER: I just gave you information about the expected agenda of meeting with Talabani. Beyond that, I don't know what issues he will bring up. However, it is natural that we will make the necessary warnings about PKK terrorism and its fight by the groups in the region and to fight them. 
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, there were Turks in Pakistan who were said to have been arrested on suspicion of having al-Qaeda connections. Later, news came that there were no Turks among those arrested. But today it is said that the family of one of those who were said to have been arrested has been extradited. What's the latest on that? 
 
 ANSWER: Last week, I briefly dwelled on that issue and said that our Islamabad Embassy is in contact with the relevant Pakistani authorities for information. There are certain mechanisms between Turkey and Pakistan. What can be done within the framework of them was evaluated. Consultations with Pakistan in the field of security cooperation will be carried out by a delegation headed by the Director General of Security Gökhan Aydıner. This delegation went to Pakistan at the beginning of the week. They will return to our country after the consultations, which will last for three days. These consultations are held within the framework of the Pakistan-Turkey Cooperation Agreement on Combating Terrorism and Organized Crime. The situation of the two Turkish citizens arrested during the operations in Lahore will also be discussed during the consultations. As you just stated, Ayşe Yılmaz, the wife of our citizen who was arrested in Lahore, was brought to our country with her child. As you know, Ayşe Yılmaz was injured in these clashes. Our Ministry is following the issue closely. I will also inform you about the next developments. 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, it is understood from your words that you have at least received an answer from Islamabad regarding the identification of persons. Was their extradition requested and how did Pakistan respond to this? 
 
 ANSWER: I just stated, I gave you some information about the current developments. After that, if you allow, I will enlighten you further within the framework of the information in the coming days. 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, Minister Abdullah Gül is going to visit the Baltic countries today. What is Turkey's expectation from this trip? As you know, before the EU Progress Report, great importance is attached to this trip. Can we get a few words from you about this? 
 
 CEVAP: Elbette. Arkadaşlarım sizlere bu gezinin programının bir örneğini dağıtacaklar. Ayrıca, bu programın ekinde bir “background” Bilgi Notu da olacak. Ancak, sizin de belirttiğiniz üzere, Sayın Bakanımız buraya yapacağı ziyaretlerde, hem ikili ilşkilerimizi bütün yönleriyle ele alacaklar, bunun ötesinde özellikle Avrupa Birliği’nin Aralık Zirvesi’nde karar alma sürecinden hemen önce beklentilerimizi, Avrupa Birliği vizyonumuzla ilgili beklentilerimizi anlatacaklar ve onlardan destek isteyecekler. Türkiye’de bugüne kadar gerçekleştirilen reformlar konusunda bilgi verecekler. Bunun yanısıra, tabiatıyla, ikili ilişkilerimizi de değerlendirecekler. Zira, biliyorsunuz heyette işadamları yer almakta. Onlar da iki ülke arasındaki ticari, ekonomik ilişkilerin geliştirilmesi, daha ileriye götürülmesi çerçevesinde bazı temaslarda bulunacaklar. 
 
 QUESTION: As you know, the Minister will meet with Talabani at 17:00 today. He will probably leave for the airport afterward. I wonder if the Minister would make the statement he envisioned for the airport while leaving the ministry. Otherwise, we will have a hard time following. It will be difficult both to be here and to go to the airport. We would be glad if you would request such a thing from the Minister. 
 
 ANSWER: I submit your request to him. Of course, this is at their discretion. Of course, we act according to how they appreciate it. 
 
 QUESTION: The subject of Barzani's visit has been discussed with Talabani, but since we are late, we will once again get a general assessment of this visit from you. Especially when the issue about the opening of the border gate came to the agenda, is there a new opening regarding these visits? 
 
 ANSWER: We mainly deal with the border crossing issue with the Iraqi government. We also ask the groups in the region to put their political weight on it. Because, as you all know, opening the second border gate will benefit these groups in all respects. 
 
 Yes guys, I understand you don't have a question. Thank you all."

 Dear friends, welcome to today's press briefing. I greet you all, as always, with love. If you will excuse me, I would like to inform you about the program as of the next day or two. 
 
 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will come to Turkey for a working meeting within the framework of his visit to the region. Tomorrow, on October 7, between 8.30 and 9.30, there will be a working breakfast with our Minister. There will naturally be delegations accompanying both ministers. It is envisaged that a Joint Press conference will be held at Housing at 9.30 am. Then the guest minister's program continues. He has meetings with our Minister of Interior and Minister of Justice. I recommend that you confirm these from the relevant Ministries. The visiting Minister will leave Ankara in the afternoon. 
 
 QUESTION: Can you give a few titles regarding your agenda? 
 
 ANSWER: The agenda consists of relations between the two countries, regional issues, and international issues concerning the two countries. Naturally, issues related to Iraq will also be discussed. 
 
 QUESTION: ...... 
 
 ANSWER: Political consultations were already going to be held between the political director of the British Foreign Office and the Undersecretary of our Ministry. As a matter of fact, the political director of the British Foreign Secretary, namely his Under-Secretary, John Sawers is also in the delegation of the Visiting Minister. In this context, Ambassador Tahsin Burcuoğlu, our Director General for Middle East and North African Affairs, is expected to hold talks with his counterparts in the delegation. 
 
 QUESTION: ........ 
 
 ANSWER: I do not know those subjects, we will learn them later. 
 
 Apart from that, you know, the Swedish Foreign Minister has come to our country. It is possible that our Minister will meet with him tomorrow.

Subsequently, a joint press conference is scheduled at 12.15. At 12.30, the Guest Minister and his delegation will have a luncheon in honor of our Honorable Minister. The visiting Minister will leave our country at 14.40 in the afternoon. 
 
 Having said this, as you all know, the Progress Report is to be announced today. As of today's schedule, if I need to give you some information based on the information we have received, Prodi is expected to hold a press conference at 12.30. I'm telling you this just for your information. You need to “check” them from the relevant authorities, organizations. At 13.00, our Prime Minister will give a speech at the PACE. It was learned that Verheugen was planning to hold a press conference at 13.30 - again, I say all this according to the information we have. In the afternoon, our Honorable Minister will hold a press conference. I'll let you know the time and place for this when we've decided. 
 
 That's all I'm going to say. If you have any questions, I will try to answer them.

 QUESTION: As of this morning, has there been phone traffic between the European interlocutors of the Minister? 
 
 ANSWER: No, he hasn't had a phone call so far, apart from the phone calls he made yesterday. 
 
 QUESTION: Can you summarize yesterday's meetings? Phone traffic last night. 
 
 ANSWER: I have explained them before. It is also in the press. It is also clearly stated in the news of the agency. However, to say it again, you know Verheugen, Fischer, Bot and Moratinos. In these meetings, as I have said before, Minister Çavuşoğlu conveyed our views and expectations regarding the progress report to his interlocutors and made their final interventions, according to the available information. 
 
 QUESTION: I want to ask something about Jack Straw. He went to Northern Iraq and during his meetings with Necirvan Barzani, he suggested postponing the Kirkuk issue ............... He wanted to stop the migration of Kurds to Kirkuk. The Kirkuk issue is a very sensitive issue in Turkey. How do you think Jack Straw goes and gives such advice to the Kurdish leaders? 
 
 ANSWER: These issues – as you know, I have just said – will naturally be evaluated in tomorrow's negotiations and talks. Minister Çavuşoğlu will also discuss these issues in detail with his interlocutor. 
 
 QUESTION: There are news that Barzani is also planning to come to Ankara or that Ankara has called him and requested a meeting. Is it true? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know about it, I'll find out and let you know. 
 
 QUESTION: Was Jack Straw's visit pre-planned, a visit that took place in the last 24 hours? 
 
 ANSWER: Not in the last 24 hours, but I think it's an issue that came up earlier this week. 
 
 QUESTION: Will Turkey accept the amendment or addition of some articles in Lausanne for EU membership? 
 
 ANSWER: If you excuse me, I do not want to answer your questions on these issues. Because, you all know, the report has not been released yet. After making the necessary evaluations, our Minister will personally tell you our views, policies and expectations on this issue and will answer your questions. 
 
 QUESTION: What is Ankara's hope and expectation regarding the report until the moment it will be announced? 
 
 ANSWER: You know that too. Naturally, we expect the EU to state in this report, in the clearest terms, that Turkey has fully fulfilled all the criteria and that Turkey has been given a negotiation date. This is our expectation. 
 
 QUESTION: Maybe it's ""off-the-record"", but after the report, can you draw a perspective on what to do next, in order to see what's ahead, in the period until 17 December? 
 
 ANSWER: It is too early for all this right now. In the process that started with the announcement of the report today, we will of course tell you on many occasions what kind of strategy we will follow and what attitude we will adopt in this regard. 
 
 QUESTION: Did Mr. Minister do his phone diplomacy last night on the rumors from Brussels or on the information sent from there? I am asking this question in terms of the content of the Progress Report. 
 
 ANSWER: You know, we have a Permanent Mission there. They are in regular and intensive contact with Commission officials and all relevant authorities there. Of course, our Minister took these initiatives based on the information received from there. 
 
 QUESTION: Are there some negativities or did he ask for a new addition, Mr. Minister? 
 
 ANSWER: As a result of the evaluations, it was concluded that it was necessary to make a series of phone calls, and then these took place. 
 
 QUESTION: Was there any response from our Minister's meeting, especially with EU ministers? 
 
 ANSWER: I said what I had to say about it. If you appreciate it, it wouldn't be right to say anything more than that. I ask you to be a little more patient. 
 
 QUESTION: The Greek Cypriot side claims that Turkey will not be able to get a date unless Turkey recognizes the customs union with Cyprus and the Greek Cypriot Administration on 17 December. Customs Union completed. A unanimous vote is required at the Summit on 17 December. The Greek administration says, “They certainly cannot get a date unless they recognize Cyprus”. How are you looking? 
 
 ANSWER: What the Greek Cypriot administration says, as always, binds the Greek administration. I want to say this much. 
 
 I understand you have no further questions. Thank you so much."

 Welcome to our press briefing today. I greet you with love. I'm not going to make any preliminary statements today. If you have questions, I'll try to answer them. 
 ------------ 
 
 QUESTION: Is it possible for you to provide information about the foreign trips that the Minister will make in the upcoming period? 
 
 ANSWER: Sure. Minister Çavuşoğlu will visit Germany on 18-19 October upon the invitation of German Foreign Minister Fischer, starting this weekend. After that, Minister Çavuşoğlu will attend the Mediterranean Forum Foreign Ministers' meeting to be held in Paris on 24-25 October. Immediately after this, on 26 October, upon the invitation of Czech Foreign Minister Svoboda, they visited the Czech Republic. In the next month, their visit to Slovakia, Portugal is planned. 
 
 QUESTION: Will there be bilateral contacts within the framework of the Paris visit? 
 
 ANSWER: Naturally. Because the foreign ministers of many countries will attend this Forum. Of course, they will meet with their interlocutors at the margin of those meetings. 
 
 QUESTION: It has been suggested that the official start of the negotiations in Europe could be made at the Turkey-EU Association Council meeting in April 2005. I wonder if Turkey accepts it to start with the Association Council meeting or what are your views on this issue? 
 
 ANSWER: The issue of starting negotiations was actually decided at the Copenhagen summit, as you all know. As you will all remember, it was clearly stated by the statement that Turkey's fulfillment of the Copenhagen criteria would be ""without delay"", right after the decision to be taken at the summit in December, as of the EU's registration with the Progress Report. Our expectation is that this ""without delay"" period should not exceed a few months. This has been clearly emphasized by our Honorable Minister many times and on various occasions. 
 
 QUESTION: I failed to ask. I felt the need to add something again. What I was trying to ask was: ""Does Ankara accept the proposal that the negotiations will be opened at the Turkey-EU Association Council meeting, or does it have an expectation that the negotiations will start with an intergovernmental conference?"" 
 
 ANSWER: Of course, the issue of how to start negotiations is clear within the framework of EU rules. This is how it will be. Therefore, as you mentioned, it is our expectation that this will be done as soon as possible. 
 
 QUESTION: Has this date been officially communicated to Ankara? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know if this has been formally communicated. I do not know whether such a date has been officially communicated to us or not. 
 
 QUESTION: There are statements from the leader of the Greek Cypriot side on the recognition of the Greek Cypriot side, before 17 December. What is Ankara's reaction regarding this? 
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, on these issues, both our Prime Minister and our Minister have made statements on various occasions. In fact, there is not much to add to them. As a matter of fact, our Prime Minister very clearly said, “As Turkey, whatever is within the Copenhagen political criteria binds us. We are working on these issues and we will continue to do so during the negotiation process.” The Greeks always come up with a series of demands. They are trying to somehow shed their responsibilities in the insolvency of the Cyprus issue. It is clear who is responsible for the deadlock in the Cyprus problem. The whole world public knows this. 
 
 QUESTION: During his contacts in Ankara, Barzani counted the Kurds as the main founding element of Kirkuk. How does Turkey want the structure of Kirkuk to be defined and what is the desired status for Kirkuk? 
 
 ANSWER: There is no change in our views on Kirkuk, which we expressed to you a long time ago. As is known, the final status of Kirkuk will be determined in the future in accordance with the temporary administrative law currently in force in Iraq. However, there are clear historical facts. In this framework, Kirkuk has been a city inhabited by various ethnic groups. The point to be noted here is that no attempt is made to change the demographic structure of the city and that the ethnic groups in question live together in peace, tranquility and security in the city. This will also form the basis of Kirkuk's future status. Everyone knows that various groups in Iraq have sensitivities on this issue. In addition, both the countries neighboring Iraq and the international community have sensitivities regarding the special status of Kirkuk. These sensitivities arise from the vital connection of the issue with the stability, peace, prosperity and balance of the region. Therefore, the final status of Kirkuk should reflect all these expectations and at the same time form the basis for Iraq to gain the identity of an exemplary country in peace, prosperity and stability with itself, its neighbors and the international community, as everyone desires. Turkey cannot stand by the fact that the status based on the aforementioned principles is changed with fait accomplis. A permanent solution to the status of Kirkuk within the framework of this constitution, which will be submitted to the approval of the Iraqi people by the elected interim parliament, which will prepare the new Iraqi constitution next year, would be a suitable method to end the discussions on Kirkuk. stems from its vital connection with their well-being and balance. Therefore, the final status of Kirkuk should reflect all these expectations and at the same time form the basis for Iraq to gain the identity of an exemplary country in peace, prosperity and stability with itself, its neighbors and the international community, as everyone desires.

As everyone wishes, it should be at peace with itself, its neighbors and the international community, and it should be of a nature that will form the basis for it to gain the identity of an exemplary country in peace, prosperity and stability. Turkey cannot stand by the fact that the status based on the aforementioned principles is changed with fait accomplis.

 After stating all this, Barzani's visit to Ankara within the past few days -as our Minister has also stated- a very comprehensive and in-depth meeting was held with him. A broad perspective has been drawn to him. Following these meetings, I thought I had expressed to you that we observed positive attitudes in the general atmosphere. As a matter of fact, he made statements confirming these issues at the airport before leaving our country. 
 
 QUESTION: I think it came up during Barzani's contacts here as well. In the elections in January, there will be a single list application. Therefore, we know that Turkey has sensitivity on the following issue; It wants the entire population to be reflected in the administration in the context of ethnic groups. It is obvious that justice cannot be achieved if elections are held with a single list application. Can we get your opinion on this? 
 
 ANSWER: Studies on this subject are not mature enough yet. We all know this. There is a serious security problem in Iraq. First of all, it is tried to be overcome. Our expectation is that the elections are made in a healthy way, in accordance with the calendar. 
 
 QUESTION: Before the extradition of Metin Kaplan, was there any contact between the authorities of the two countries regarding the acceleration of the recent events? ........ how do you evaluate? 
 
 ANSWER: First of all, I must say this. The issue of Metin Kaplan's extradition is now within the jurisdiction of our judicial authorities. However, to give a brief background on this, Metin Kaplan is a person wanted at the international level for attempting to overthrow the constitutional order by force since 1997 and whose extradition has been requested from Germany since 1999. He was deported to Turkey as of 12 October 2004. He was granted refugee status by the German authorities in 1992, and he was sentenced to four years in prison twice for inciting the public to commit crimes in Germany, and was released in May 2003. Our extradition request regarding the aforementioned has been the subject of numerous negotiations between the parties, and the last time, with the decision of the Dusseldorf administrative court on 27 May 2003, refused the return request. However, as a result of the ongoing negotiations, Metin Kaplan was deported from Germany and sent to our country, with the decision of the Cologne administrative court, taking into account the crimes he committed in Germany. 
 
 QUESTION: I have two questions. One of them, in his statements at the airport on his way from Turkey, stated that he was in agreement on many issues during his meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. What are the issues on which this consensus is reached? 
 
 Secondly, has a commission been established to monitor Israel's activities both in northern Iraq and in Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Region? If so, what units are there in this commission? 
 
 ANSWER: Regarding your first question, I think that the explanations I made in response to the previous questions are inclusive. 
 
 Regarding your second question, I don't know about such a commission. 
 
 QUESTION: As we understand, Barzani made a request to open the airspace during his Ankara visit. 
 
 
 ANSWER: This issue, I think, may have been discussed during technical discussions. I must confirm this to you. However, in my statement a while ago in response to a question with the same meaning, I emphasized that this request should be made to our authorities by the central Iraqi government, if the conditions for such matters mature. In that case, the request will of course be duly evaluated. 
 
 QUESTION: In this context, during Barzani's visit, views were exchanged on the opening of the second border gate and Barzani said that technical studies were carried out on this issue while he was leaving. Could you give information about these studies? 
 
 ANSWER: If you allow, I would like to tell you about them in more detail after I have the necessary information. 
 
 I understand you have no further questions. Thank you all so much."

 It is a fact that a new era has begun in our neighbor Iraq. During this period, the Iraqi people seek and expect a more just, democratic regime that respects human rights and freedoms. 
 
 We hope that the general elections scheduled for January 30 will constitute an important opportunity and turning point for the Iraqi people to determine their own future within the parameters in line with these principles. 
 
 Based on this understanding, the Republic of Turkey supported the political process, encouraged all layers of the Iraqi people, including the Sunnis, to participate in the elections in the widest way possible, and provided Iraqis living in its own lands the opportunity to vote in the elections. 
 
 The failure of these elections to meet the rightful demands and expectations of certain strata of the Iraqi people may not only cause serious problems of legitimacy in Iraq, but also lead to conditions that may harm the spirit of unity and solidarity among the elements that make up the Iraqi people, and that may endanger peace and stability in the regional plan. can open. Turkey has emphasized on every occasion that such developments should not be allowed. 
 
 Since April 2003, we have heard that there has been an artificial and illegitimate population relocation to Kirkuk and its surroundings from among the elements living in various regions of northern Iraq. It is known that this movement accelerated in 2004 and continued with varying intervals until recently. 
 
 Iraqis from different social strata in the region confirm that this process took place under the guise of correcting the wrong policies of the old regime, but at a level and intensity that is inconsistent with historical data, and that it was also encouraged and supported materially and politically by certain political parties and formations. However, there are established methods and mechanisms for reversion. They must be operated legitimately. 
 
 In the 21st century, no one can expose anyone's land to illegal fait accomplis. Under the umbrella of freedom, justice and democracy, it is unacceptable that groups that oppose erroneous policies and practices, under the guise of putting an end to the distorted order and policies of the past, commit the same mistakes themselves this time. 
 
 The people of Kirkuk, who have lived together in peace and brotherhood for centuries, are expressing their concerns to us that some elements are heading towards a mistake that may have grave consequences. They report that hundreds of thousands of settlers have been moved to Kirkuk, and that most of these people neither they nor their families have historical connections with Kirkuk. 
 
 Our message at this stage to all Iraqis, to the UN and to the international community, who advocate that democracy and justice will prevail in Iraq in the new era, is that such practices and fait accompli will not contribute to the establishment of lasting social peace and tranquility in Iraq and will have negative effects on the stability of the entire region, therefore, it will be in the form of a careful examination of the initiatives and practices mentioned and doing what is necessary. Once again, we call on all parties involved to act on the basis of common sense and legitimacy. 
 
 The second point I would like to mention is that, despite all the transportation difficulties, our Minister's extraordinary efforts and devotion in reaching our citizens in Maldives and Srilanka after the earthquake that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004, in meeting their urgent needs and in ensuring their return to Turkey, is due to Turkey. They sent a thank you message to Mrs. Bharathi Wijeratne, Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Colombo, and İsmail Hilmy, Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Turkey to Mali. 
 
 Thirdly, I would like to give you a brief information. The Palestinian Embassy in Ankara informed us that they would be pleased if some of the qurbans, which are under the control of the Turkish Religious Foundation, are made in Palestine by proxy and distributed to those in need. Upon this request, contact was established between the Turkish Religious Foundation and the Palestine Sacrifice Committee through our Consulate General in Jerusalem, and our citizens were provided with the opportunity to have a sacrifice in Palestine under the supervision of the aforementioned committee. In this context, interested citizens should apply to the Turkish Religious Foundation. 
 
 That's all I'm going to tell you. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them as well. 
 
 ------------ 
 
 QUESTION: Recently, there have been high-level statements that the United States does not exclude the option of a military intervention in Iran, and there are some media reports in this direction. In terms of regional peace, in terms of regional stability, how does Turkey respond to such an option, how does it respond to these news? 
 
 ANSWER: As Turkey, we are in favor of the continuation of the dialogue with Iran. As you know, we also support the negotiation process opened by the EU Trio. In parallel with this, we expect the International Energy Agency to announce its final decision on Iran's nuclear activities to the international public as soon as possible. 
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that the Arabs and Kurds agreed on the Kirkuk issue, that an agreement was signed, and that the British and American Ambassadors also signed this agreement. Does Turkey know about this issue? 
 
 ANSWER: As you can appreciate, I made a very comprehensive explanation. So other than that, I have nothing to say. 
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that the Commission's screening process will continue for one year regarding the negotiations with the EU. There have been statements in that direction. The Turkish side, namely the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, says that this process will take three months. What is this situation, can you explain about it? 
 
 ANSWER: As you all know, it is not possible to predict how long the screening process will take before this process has started. In line with the 1999 Helsinki Summit resolutions, an analytical review covering 31 chapters has already been carried out within eight subcommittees since 2000. The minutes of this subcommittee were also submitted to the Association Committee and the Association Council and approved. These studies will form the basis of the scanning process. As such, the duration of the screening process is not expected to be very long. What we mainly focus on is that the membership negotiations with Turkey officially started on 3 October 2005. The next process will continue within its own dynamics and for certain periods depending on the performance of our country. 
 
 QUESTION: My first question is about the elections scheduled for January 30 in Iraq. Turkey had made a request that two PKK-linked parties not be included in the elections. Any progress on this? As far as I can remember, there was a commitment from the Iraqi authorities that they would look into it. 
 
 My second question is that AKP officials had an invitation to the leader of the main opposition party in the Greek part of the country to visit Turkey. Did the ministry know about this invitation? 
 
 ANSWER: Let's start with your first question. You know, it is known that the terrorist organization is trying to politicize in Iraq by using some Iraqi citizens who support it. Another dimension of this initiative is manifested in the inclusion of political formations that it can use in the future, in accordance with the current legislation in the national system in Iraq. The Iraqi interim government was asked to investigate the matter and to prosecute the two parties that we consider to be related to the terrorist organization, and this issue was finally discussed in the trilateral meetings held in Ankara on 11 January and in the bilateral meetings with the Iraqi delegation. The Iraqi interim government has committed that the matter will be investigated and that no anti-Turkish entity will be allowed to operate from Iraqi territory against our country. The next phase of the issue concerns the Iraqi national legislation and the interim government. The information available in our authorities on this matter has been conveyed to the Iraqi administration and as you all will appreciate, we will continue to monitor the issue closely. 
 
 Regarding your second question, I personally have no knowledge. However, I will ask the relevant departments about the issue and I will inform you. 
 
 QUESTION: How does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs receive this invitation to DISI from a diplomatic point of view? 
 
 ANSWER: As I said, in order for me to comment on this subject, I need to have knowledge. If you'll excuse me, I'll ask him, and then I'll tell you. 
 
 QUESTION: I think some Turkish associations in Western Thrace have been banned from using the word Turk. Do you have any comments on it? Did we give any note, did we make an attempt before Greece? 
 
 ANSWER: The legal process, which started with the lawsuit filed by the Xanthi governorship on January 30, 1984, with the demand for the closure of the Xanthi Turkish Union, which was established by our Western Thrace cognates as an association for social, cultural and sportive purposes, on the grounds that the word ""Turkish"" was in its name. As you have stated, the information that the decision to close the Xanthi Turkish Union, which was taken on the date of 18th, resulted in the approval of the decision, was reflected in our press. The news on this subject is naturally alarming. We think it would be beneficial to wait for the legal process on the subject to be clarified. Of course, the attitude we will take following the clarification of this decision will be evaluated accordingly. 
 
 QUESTION: In your statement about Iraq, I wondered what your point of view was towards boycotting the elections. At the beginning, of course, you talk about contributing to the election process, but in the second part, you specifically referred to the change in the democratic structure with a Kurdish population. How does the Republic of Turkey respond to the preparations of some Iraqi groups to boycott the elections? 
 
 ANSWER: I believe that all these issues are answered in my explanation. Therefore, I do not want to interpret this comprehensive explanation further, if you allow me. 
 
 QUESTION: The borders in Iraq are being closed for the elections. Within this framework, Habur would also be closed. Have any precautions been taken? What has been done regarding the security of elections and border security? 
 
 ANSWER: We understand that this was taken within the framework of the Iraqi interim government's need for a security measure due to the elections. 
 
 QUESTION: Did Turkey take any precautions beforehand? 
 
 ANSWER: This is a temporary shutdown. In elections held all over the world, it is natural to take some temporary measures during the election. So it will be up the next day. Everyone knows that too. In this framework, our relevant authorities will make their arrangements there in accordance with this measure. 
 
 QUESTION: There has been a lot of news about the Prime Minister's request to meet with Kofi Annan. Has the Minister ever requested a meeting with Kofi Annan? 
 
 ANSWER: No, I have no information that our Minister has made such a request. 
 
 QUESTION: Will the Minister attend the ceremony in Auschwitz? 
 
 ANSWER: That issue is not clear yet. 
 
 I understand you have no questions. I congratulate you all again on the holiday and wish you a happy holiday."

Turkoman leadership would like to hope that the errors and wrong-doings committed by the former regimes will not be repeated in the new era and the wounds of the past will be healed. 
 
 In the aftermath of the intervention, we have been observing that certain Iraqi groups have been upholding ethnic and sectarian discrimination by tabling excessive demands and claims which may cause new and graver injustices under the pretext of rectifying unlawful practices of the past. Currently Iraq is faced with a number of delicate problems. Some of these problems have implications beyond Iraq and may undermine regional and international peace and security. The future status of Kirkuk and preservation of its pluralist character are among the sensitivities that I have just mentioned. 
 
 We deem it necessary to remind once again that all parties and the concerned need to meticulously refrain from statements and attempts that may sow the seeds of hostility among different segments of the Iraqi society and drift the country into an undesirable climate of anarchy, instability and state of civil strife."

 An important phase in Iraq’s future will commence following the January 30th elections. The Interim Parliament and the Government which will be formed after the elections will also assume the responsibility of administering the constitutional process which may have a determining effect over the future of the country. 
 
 January 30th elections will provide an opportunity to expedite the political transition in Iraq, establish Iraq’s national unity and territorial integrity on solid foundations, promote lasting peace and stability in the region, as well as for the people of Iraq to embrace peace and well-being, through a democratic and representative government. 
 
 We are aware of the extremely difficult conditions under which the elections will take place and of the very existence of serious problems of participation in the elections for certain segments of the Iraqi people which constitute inseparable parts of the population. These problems need to be resolved in a fair and a pragmatic manner for the sake of social peace and stability in Iraq. Matters such as voter turnout, whether or not the democratic will of the nation will be reflected to election results in a just and equitable manner can only be evaluated once the results are announced. 
 
 Turkey supported the political process in Iraq based on the principle of preservation of Iraq’s national unity and territorial integrity at various fora such as the conference of Iraq’s Neighbors, the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, OSCE and the OIC. With this understanding in mind, we have made provisions for the Iraqis living in Turkey to cast their votes during the elections (OCV) within the framework agreed upon between the Iraqi Independent Election Commission and the IMO. 
 
 After January 30th elections, restoration of law and order, securing of the broadest possible representation of all segments of the Iraqi society, participation in the political and constitutional processes in the newly established order will be among the topics that will have to receive prior consideration. 
 
 In this current phase of events, it will be important, as much as the international community’s sensitivity towards the rights and expectations of the Iraqi people, that the people of Iraq also act with a sense of reason in responding to the expectations of the neighboring countries and the international community regarding peace, security and stability. Therefore, we call upon all segments of the fraternal people of Iraq to act in a spirit of responsible citizenship and national conscience; to be mindful of the crucial nature of the current process for the future of their society, to exercise their right to vote which is one of the main pillars of their citizenship rights and legitimacy, to seize this opportunity to establish a new national consensus, and to put the interests of the nation above narrow group interests. 
 
 In the same vein, we call upon the Interim Government of Iraq, all the political leaders of the Iraqi people, the Coalition Forces in Iraq, the United Nations and the wider international community to be sensitive in the face of the complexities and to take effective steps with a view not to allow the shortcomings and obstacles jeopardize the political process and peace in Iraq."
13/2/2005,2/13/2005,"No:23 - 13 Şubat 2005, Irak Seçim Sonuçları Hk.","No:23 - February 13th, 2005, Press Release Regarding the Results of the Iraqi Elections (Unofficial Translation)",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/_p_no_23---february-13th_-2005_-press-release-regarding-the-results-of-the-iraqi-elections-_unofficial-translation___p_.en.mfa,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"In the Press Release issued by the Ministry subsequent to January 30, 2005 elections, it has been stated that the final outcome of the elections would be assessed once the counting of the votes was complete. 
 
 Today the preliminary results of the national and provincial elections have been announced by the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq. 
 
 The fact that elections could have taken place in Iraq indicates that notwithstanding all problems and security challenges, the Iraqis both in Iraq and abroad made their choice in favor of democracy. 
 
 On the other hand, low level of participation by certain segments of the Iraqi society, non-participation in several provinces, as well as imbalances and irregularities over the results in certain others, including Kirkuk, due to manipulations are issues that await earnest resolution. 
 
 It has become obvious that certain elements of the Iraqi society attempted to manipulate the voting procedure and extracted illegal gains out of this practice. We’d expect that the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq will examine the complaints about the election irregularities meticulously and take the necessary steps to settle them. We would also expect that the United Nations will carry out the necessary reviews within the framework of its responsibilities in line with UNSC Resolution 1546. 
 
 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Iraqi Transitional Assembly will not reflect the true proportionality of various segments of the Iraqi society. 
 
 The aim of these elections had been the constitution of the transitional Assembly. However, the above mentioned shortcomings raise serious concerns as regards the achievability of this objective. In this case, for the sake of the political process in Iraq, the lack of representation of certain groups and the imbalance in the administration of the country should be rectified during the drafting of the new constitution and prior to the elections due for the end of this year. The United Nations also should take a more active role in this process. 
 
 We wish that the shortcomings, irregularities and infringement of the rules that took place in January 30, 2005 elections will not reoccur during the constitutional referendum and the elections to be held according to the laws and regulations that will be enacted under it at the end of this year and consequently, the conditions are secured for a more fair and credible representation of all segments of the Iraqi society. We consider that the presence of international observers for the upcoming referendum and elections is indispensable and preparations need to be launched from now towards that end. 
 
 With this understanding, Turkey will continue maintaining dialogue with all segments of the Iraqi society, supporting the steps taken by Iraq towards establishing a democratic regime reassuring its national unity and territorial integrity, and participating actively in international efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region and in the world."

 Dear Friends, welcome to our press briefing today. I greet you all with love. I will not have any explanation. If you have questions, I will try to answer them. 
 ------------ 
 
 QUESTION: At the beginning of March, a meeting will be held on aid to Palestine, hosted by the UK. There are participants from EU countries, D-8 and regional countries to the meeting. Have you received an invitation to Turkey? 
 
 ANSWER: If I am not mistaken, a friend of ours asked this question in our last meeting. I said it back then. We are not Quartet members. Essentially, this is a gathering of the Quartet and donors who have contributed large amounts of money. In this respect, there was no invitation to us, as I said last time. 
 
 QUESTION: Well, in addition, I would like to ask; Do you have any information about the context in which Tunisia was invited? Would you also have a desire to participate? Would you like to be present at such a meeting? 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know the list of invitees, who the participants are. I don't know if Tunisia was invited either. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. 
 
 QUESTION: As of yesterday, the Foreign Relations Committee of the British House of Commons has released a report. Here, direct flights to the TRNC are requested to be approved, and at the same time, it is recommended that Turkey withdraw its troops from Cyprus. I don't know, have you seen the report? Do you have an evaluation? 
 
 ANSWER: Yes, we have also received the report, which is understood to have been prepared by the Foreign Relations Committee of the British House of Commons and contains some suggestions for the solution of the Cyprus problem. We also know that during the preparation of this report, the House of Commons officials went to the TRNC and made contacts. As you mentioned, we are examining this 90-page, very comprehensive report in detail. 
 
 QUESTION: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia will have a visit here tomorrow, announced by your Ministry. Is it possible to say something about the details of this meeting? Considering that the guest country is also a new EU member, will there be a comprehensive private meeting especially on the EU, is there any detail on this issue? 
 
 ANSWER: I can tell you that this visit is of an official nature. Beyond that, my friends will give you detailed information about the program at the end of this briefing. Naturally, EU issues will form a certain part of the agenda in these meetings, but beyond that, regional issues and current international issues concerning the two countries, especially our bilateral relations, will of course be discussed and evaluated. 
 
 QUESTION: In the news regarding the NATO Summit, it was stated that Turkey's veto on the Cyprus issue was an obstacle to the development of relations between NATO and the EU, and there were suggestions from the EU and the UK that Turkey should be more flexible in this direction. What does Turkey think about the Greek Cypriot's participation in NATO-EU activities? Have there really been suggestions in this direction? 
 
 ANSWER: As you all know, yesterday, both our Prime Minister and Mr. Minister were asked questions about this issue in Brussels and they answered them in detail. Beyond that, I have nothing to tell you. 
 
 QUESTION: Work on the EU negotiation team continues. I think the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has a role in these studies. Are you in a position to give us some information about the level of the work carried out and the point it has reached? 
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, this issue is being evaluated at the political level. You all know this, we are watching it together. Therefore, at the technical level, not only our institution but also other institutions make the necessary suggestions to the political authorities. Beyond that, we cannot have any authority over who or how the chief negotiator will be. We will wait for this together. 
 
 QUESTION: We know that the Undersecretary is going to make a trip to America. Can you share the timing of this and the information about whom to meet if it is clear? 
 
 ANSWER: This visit is on the agenda, but at this stage there is no clarity on its details. 
 
 QUESTION: What is Turkey's policy regarding the training of Iraqi security forces within the framework of the decisions taken at the NATO Summit? There are various options. They are trained there, brought to Turkey, donated money etc. Can you give information about this? 
 
 ANSWER: As you will remember, Special Trust Fund arrangements were made some time ago in order to contribute to the training of Iraqi security forces within the framework of NATO facilities. Member countries contribute in kind and financially to this project, which is being implemented in line with the NATO Summit Decisions. For this purpose, as you all know, two of our officers are serving in the NATO mission in Baghdad. Our Prime Minister announced that 100 thousand euros will be contributed to this fund at the NATO extraordinary summit held in Brussels. 
 
 In addition, Turkey has confirmed to NATO that within the framework of this project, together with some other NATO members, it may open certain military training and facility facilities to programs to be organized for the training of new Iraqi security forces. If you ask what kind of training these are, I can give you a few examples. Subjects such as training of border security forces, response to social events, internal security course, fight against terrorism and smuggling, humanitarian aid in natural disasters. 
 
 QUESTION: The USA had a shipping center request to use Incirlik as a logistics center. Is there any progress on this issue, at what stage are the evaluations? 
 
 ANSWER: I gave you some information about your question a few weeks ago. There is not the slightest change in that information. Evaluation is ongoing. Therefore, there is nothing more to be said at this stage. 
 
 QUESTION: There were requests from the EU that a protocol that would extend the Customs Union Agreement to include the Greek Cypriot administration and that the Ankara Agreement would be adapted should be initialed by Turkey until the end of February and the beginning of March. What is the level of preparations or negotiations in this direction? Do you have any information? 
 
 ANSWER: Preparations continue. 
 
 QUESTION: As a continuation of this question, Mr. Minister made a statement in a program he attended yesterday in Brussels. If I am not mistaken, we will start negotiating this protocol text with the Commission at the beginning of the month. What does he mean by starting a negotiation? Isn't the exchange of documents with the Commission part of the negotiation? Or will an initial start be made before this negotiation begins, and then negotiations will begin? Can you shed some light on this issue? Especially the view of the Ministry on the protocol. 
 
 ANSWER: As I have just mentioned, evaluation studies continue. Therefore, our only date for this is October 3, as I mentioned a while ago. Before October 3, it was stated to you at various levels that this would be signed. There is no change in our attitude. Until that date, if these studies are completed and the evaluations are completed, this protocol will be signed at any time deemed appropriate. 
 
 QUESTION: On the same issue, it is said that at the beginning of March, before the visit of the Troika, a delegation from Turkey will go to Brussels to negotiate the additional harmonization protocol. Who does this delegation consist of from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Is the exact date known? 
 
 ANSWER: I personally do not know that such a delegation will go, but I will ask the relevant department. I'll let you know when I get information. 
 
 QUESTION: The ITF has received quite a lot of reactions to the claims of Turkey that the Turkmens are not sufficiently organized in the elections. Reactions criticizing the words of Prime Minister Erdogan. In fact, Kurdish parties are discussing not participating in the elections together with the Kurds at this stage. Among them, there are discourses that accuse Turkey in a way. Will you have an answer? 
 
 ANSWER: I gave a very detailed answer to this question, as you will remember, a week ago. So I ask your permission not to say more. 
 
 Well guys, thank you very much. So we conclude our press briefing for today."

 QUESTION: After the rejection of the European Union Constitution in France and the Netherlands, statements were made that this process would not affect Turkey's European Union process, and that the Nice Agreement in particular was the legal basis. But there is one comment: In the Nice Agreement, the number of EU members was limited to 27, that this quota will be filled with the membership of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007, and Turkey's membership will be extended in this process due to the rejection of the new Constitution. What are your thoughts on this? 
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, we all see that the EU has been facing some difficulties lately and we are watching the related developments. The EU is a large institution. We hope that you will leave these troubles behind after a certain period of time. I have told you before that this process is not related to Turkey. In addition, our Prime Minister, Minister and Chief Negotiator Ali Babacan made statements in this direction. The important thing for us is the decision of December 17 and keeping the promises made here. We expect the negotiations to start on 3 October within the framework of the decisions taken on 17 December. The arguments that Turkey created problems in this process are invalid. As a matter of fact, if I am not mistaken, former Commissioner Verheugen responsible for enlargement made very broad statements on this subject yesterday. 
 
 QUESTION: Do you think there is a quota problem? Will there be a problem with Turkey's membership, or will it somehow be overcome? 
 
 ANSWER: I said what I had to say about it. 
 
 QUESTION: There is talk of the Greek Cypriots' requests to open embassies and representations in Turkey. What is Turkey's stance on this issue? 
 
 ANSWER: Turkey's stance on this issue is quite clear. Turkey does not and will not recognize the Greek Cypriot Administration of Southern Cyprus. Therefore, it is out of question for an Administration not recognized by Turkey to open a Representative Office or similar requests. 
 
 QUESTION: We heard about the embassy request from the press. But has there been any direct or indirect demand that has been reflected to you outside of the press? Our stance is clear. 
 
 ANSWER: We also heard from the press. 
 
 QUESTION: At what stage is the process of signing the additional protocol currently? A small procedure from the EU had to be completed in this regard. Is it complete, or is there a specific date or range of dates for signing it? 
 
 ANSWER: The protocol will be signed after the EU finishes its procedural studies on the agreed text. It is necessary to ask the EU when it will complete these processes. In the coming days, they will probably announce to us that they have completed these procedures. After that, there will be a signing process. 
 
 QUESTION: Is there any development regarding the letter of Armenian President Kocharyan? It was evaluated last. 
 
 ANSWER: There is no change. Our evaluations are ongoing. 
 
 QUESTION: Mesut Barzani was elected President of the Kurdish Federation. What is Turkey's view of this election? How do you evaluate? 
 
 ANSWER: As you know, the constitutional process has just begun in Iraq. The efforts to establish the constitution writing commission to include the entire Iraqi people are still in progress. It is understood from the current political environment in Iraq that the constitution to be prepared will envisage a federal structure. As a matter of fact, the current Iraqi interim administrative law also stipulates that a democratic, pluralistic and federal republic will be established in this country, but it stipulates that federalism should be defined according to geographical and administrative criteria, not ethnic or sectarian principles. In the upcoming political process, the future structure of Iraq will only take its final shape with the completion of the constitution, and this structure will gain legitimacy with the social consensus of the Iraqi people by ratifying the constitution. 
 
 QUESTION: You have repeated what you said as the Foreign Ministry several times, but when we look at the Presidential law, that is, when we look at the law enacted by the Iraqi Kurdistan region administration that accepted Barzani as president, we see that it contains elements beyond federalism. For example, there are some factors that Barzani may or may not give permission for the operations to be carried out by the Iraqi central army in the north, after obtaining the permission of the regional parliament. Therefore, what does it mean for Turkey to be elected President before the constitution is prepared, even before its commission even works properly. If the Iraqi constitution is formed in a different direction, will the actual situation there continue or not? If so, what would Turkey's view be? 
 
 ANSWER: Actually, I don't want to comment too much on what I just said, but you asked what it means. It doesn't make much sense. I can underline it. 
 
 QUESTION: Is there any development regarding the date of the tripartite meeting, which was decided to be held after the Minister's contacts in America? 
 
 ANSWER: No, there isn't. We will notify you immediately if any clarity on this matter arises. 
 
 QUESTION: A new person in charge of Cyprus affairs has been appointed as Annan's assistant, replacing Prendergast. I can't remember his name right now. How do you evaluate him as Turkey? He especially said that his first aim, namely one of them, was to establish peace in Cyprus as soon as possible. 
 
 ANSWER: Our aim is the same. We want peace in Cyprus as soon as possible. We are continuing our efforts to achieve a comprehensive solution as soon as possible. 
 
 QUESTION: Is there any information about the future programs of the Minister, or the programs of the visitors who will visit Turkey? 
 
 ANSWER: As you know, our Minister will attend the EU summit meeting this weekend. Next week the EU has a meeting on Iraq. They are here to participate. At the end of the month, he is expected to pay a visit to Yemen on the occasion of the OIC meeting. These are the ones I can remember. If there is anything else, I will let you know. 
 
 QUESTION: Again, I would like to ask a question about various interpretations. In summary, after the rejection of the Constitution, there are comments that Turkey will start negotiations with the EU on October 3, but that France will create serious obstacles in the negotiations. What is Turkey's point of view at this point? Does he think that such additional obstacles will be put in his way? 
 
 ANSWER: Various comments are made. However, there is one point that is not available for interpretation. That is the decision taken on 17 December. This decision is under the signature of all EU member states. What has been said here is also clear. We all know this. Negotiations will begin on 3 October. Turkey has fully fulfilled its responsibilities. Therefore, other discussions and opinions do not bind us. 
 
 I understand you have no further questions. 
 
 Friends, you know, the Balkan Strategy and Research Centers Cooperation Conference was held in Ankara at the weekend. A result document was published at this meeting. I am distributing the Turkish and English texts of this to you. Here, it was aimed to establish a communication network between the Balkan Strategy and Research Centers. The decisions taken on this and related issues were announced to the public with a result document. I will distribute them to you through my friends. Thank you all and thus closing our briefing today."

I warmly greet you all. I would like to start our meeting today by sharing a short information note with you. I'll take your questions later. 
 
 On August 15, 2005, when Israel's unilateral withdrawal plan from the entire Gaza strip and a part of the West Bank began to be implemented, our Prime Minister sent a message each to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, expressing his gratitude for the implementation of Turkey's withdrawal plan. stressed his satisfaction and expressed his hope that the successful implementation of the plan will create a new peace dynamic that will ensure the revitalization of the peace process. 
 
 In his messages, our esteemed Prime Minister expressed appreciation for the determined attitude of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon for the implementation of the plan and the constructive approach of Palestinian National Authority President Abbas. They also emphasized their determination to help. 
 
 That's all I'm going to say. If you have questions, I'll try to answer them. 
 
 ………………… 
 
 
 QUESTION: The announcement of the Iraqi constitution has been delayed for a week, and it seems that the debates in Iraq, especially on federalism and Kirkuk, are entangled. In an article by Nechirvan Barzani, published in the Financial Times, there are evaluations that the Kurds are particularly insistent on Kirkuk and that they want to own the oil even if oil revenues are distributed. How do you evaluate both these statements and the latest situation in the Iraqi Constitution? 
 
 ANSWER: We closely follow the constitutional studies in Iraq. We observe that all groups contributed actively to these studies. All groups are trying to reconcile their interests with the general interests of Iraq. Our desire, as you all know very well, is the formation of an Iraq with political unity and territorial integrity. In addition, it is the emergence of a constitution that all groups will accept, adopt and approve. We will continue to monitor the next process, as we have done so far. 
 
 QUESTION: How do you evaluate the release of Turkish researcher Metin Türkyılmaz in Armenia, his sentence first, and then the postponement of the sentence? There was a process that started with a letter sent by Prime Minister Erdogan a while ago. Is there any recent development between Turkey and Armenia regarding this process? What is the latest status? 
 
 ANSWER: Today, I followed the news about the aforementioned researcher from the newspapers. It turns out that they are correct. However, as you all know, we do not have diplomatic relations with Armenia. Therefore, it may take some time before we can confirm the issues reflected in the news. I will pass on the information we will receive in the coming days. Regarding the process that you stated to have started before, there is no development at this stage. 
 
 QUESTION: In Afghanistan, the Taliban guerrillas kidnapped a Lebanese engineer working for a Turkish company and they say that if the Turkish company does not withdraw from Afghanistan, this engineer will be killed. I wonder if there is any work carried out in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this subject? 
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information on this subject, but I will research and inform you. 
 
 QUESTION: There are contradictory statements from the EU regarding Turkey's start of negotiations. We know that Ankara has started some diplomatic initiatives. Could you give us some information about the outcome of the talks with France? On October 3, Ankara expects to start negotiations or is it ready? 
 
 ANSWER: As you all know, there is currently nothing to prevent the start of negotiations on 3 October. There is a decision taken on December 17. It is true, as you have stated, our delegations at various levels are visiting various Capitals until October 3 to exchange views with their EU counterparts. These contacts will continue in the coming days. When necessary, we will inform you about their content and results. 
 
 QUESTION: There are allegations that some Turkish diplomats bribed some congressmen in the United States in interviews with a Turkish-American named Sibel Edmonds, who worked in the FBI in the past. These are in the press. Do you have any explanation or information on this subject? 
 
 ANSWER: I have not heard the statements of the person you mentioned. It is unthinkable for Turkish diplomats to engage in such actions. If such allegations are made, they have no basis. 
 
 QUESTION: There was also news in the press that a Note would be given regarding the crossing of PKK militants at the border with Iraq. Will there be such an initiative? 
 
 ANSWER: There was no such Note. I have mentioned this point before in answer to your questions. There is no further development beyond this. 
 
 QUESTION: We know that the government is in the process of making changes to the anti-terrorism law, and even working on it. There were also changes made with the EU harmonization packages. In this process, what kind of contribution or criticism will the Foreign Ministry make to the amendments to the Anti-Terror Law? How do you evaluate these works? 
 
 ANSWER: These are technical studies. It is not possible for me to summarize or adequately explain all this in response to a question here. We'll talk about these issues later. 
 
 QUESTION: Again, among the news in the press were the news that first France and then the Greek Cypriot Administration of Southern Cyprus made an official application to England and demanded changes in the Negotiation Framework Document. What is the attitude of the Foreign Ministry about this, what is its knowledge? 
 
 ANSWER: In this process, we hear a lot of speculative news from various sources, especially Greek Cypriot sources. They should not be trusted. We make the necessary contacts and explain our attitudes and opinions to our interlocutors. 
 
 So I close today's press conference and thank you all."
17/01/2006,1/17/2006,"17 Ocak 2006, Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Namık Tan´ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı","17 January 2006, Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Namık Tan",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/17-ocak-2006_-disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-namik-tan_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi-.tr.mfa,,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,PKK,0,0,"TAN: Welcome to the first press briefing of the new year. I warmly greet you all. On this occasion, I congratulate you once again on your past holiday. I wish you all health, success and happiness in the new year.
 
 Before I take your questions, I'll have a brief explanation or two.
 
 The first is a statement on the mandatory cullings made within the framework of bird flu. Within the scope of the fight against bird flu disease seen in some regions of our country, in order to prevent the spread of bird flu, poultry within a three-kilometer radius around the regions where the disease is seen are compulsorily culled by local disease control center authorities, including poultry in some other risky areas. It is anticipated that poultry culling procedures will continue.
 
 In culling procedures, the ""humane killing of animals in disease control"" guideline of the world animal health organization is adhered to. As a matter of fact, there are related explanations in the chicken plague emergency action plan of our Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.
 
 However, there have been practices in which sufficient sensitivity has not been shown in the culling processes in the fight against bird flu, and various reactions have been expressed both in the Turkish and international public opinion on this issue. We welcome the aforementioned sensitivities and reactions with understanding. The places where such unlawful culling was carried out were determined and the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs were warned immediately, and the necessary arrangements were made and are continuing to be taken by our authorities to ensure that such incidents do not recur.
 
 The second issue is about an article in Cumhuriyet newspaper today. There is a news about the radar to be deployed in Iskenderun in the newspaper Cumhuriyet on 17 January 2006. As emphasized in the press release of our Ministry regarding the same issue in the 22 December 2005 edition of the aforementioned newspaper, the radar in the Keseciktepe location will be installed by the Turkish Air Force Command, using NATO joint funds to be operated and used for Turkey's security. The construction and communication works of the aforementioned radar have been completed, but the radar itself has not been received and installed yet. Therefore, the facility was not operational. For this reason, there is currently no personnel at the facility in question, and the security measures mentioned in the news do not differ from other similar military facilities.
 
 After expressing these issues, if you have any questions, I will try to answer them.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, is there any new development regarding the 3 Turkish citizens kidnapped in Iran?
 
 ANSWER: No, there is no new development. All efforts are made to rescue our citizens, in cooperation with the competent authorities of the countries concerned, by our relevant authorities, especially by our Ministry. However, as you all will appreciate, it sometimes takes time to reach a conclusion in such cases.
 
 By the way, although the interest you and your families show in following this issue is quite natural, the exaggeration of this does not actually make it easier for our citizens to be rescued safely and safely. I think it is important for you to know this too.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, based on your statement about bird flu, you said that there are some discomforts in foreign public opinion. I wonder which countries or institutions have expressed discomfort to Ankara, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this issue. Can you tell him? Again, there was a news about bird flu in Greece yesterday. Regarding Greece's advice to its citizens not to travel to Turkey. I wonder what is your evaluation on this subject, are there any travel warnings in this direction from neighboring countries?
 
 ANSWER: Regarding the first part of your question, the images projected from Turkey caused reactions from the public and some non-governmental organizations abroad and especially in various European countries. These reactions have reached our relevant representatives and our Ministry. As I tried to emphasize in the explanation a little while ago, we welcome this sensitivity with understanding. Necessary measures have been taken and continue to be taken to prevent such misdemeanors from recurring. We will find out which countries or which organizations these are in the coming days, and we will explain them to you.
 
 If I am not mistaken, the second part of your question was whether there is a travel ban in neighboring countries. Such information has not been submitted to our Ministry. However, I can say this. Of course, it is natural for some countries to closely monitor the developments here and take the arrangements they deem appropriate accordingly. They do this by informing us. Within the framework of the information that has reached me so far, no warning has emerged in any country such as not going to Turkey.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, for a few days, there have been reports in both the British and Turkish press that Israel will bomb Iran over Northern Iraq. Has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received any information about this?
 
 There was no answer
 
 QUESTION: What are your thoughts on its seriousness?
 
 ANSWER: I don't think it's serious.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, Mehmet Ali Ağca has been released and it arouses great interest in the Turkish press. Did you have any contact with the Vatican after your release? When we go back to 2000 and think about the extradition conditions, is there any provision in the international arena to bind? Was the Vatican informed before or after the evacuation process?
 
 ANSWER: Of course, I couldn't understand what the whole thing has to do with the Vatican. This is an event that takes place entirely within Turkish law. It would be appropriate to discuss this with our Ministry of Justice and other relevant institutions. Their thoughts, decisions, opinions are essential.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey was recently reported in a Greek newspaper in Turkish Northern Cyprus newspapers, claiming that they had seized a document dated January 11, which Turkey sent to the EU, and that there was a statement that Turkey would not approve the Additional Protocol law unless the regulations were passed. Do you have any comments on this?
 
 ANSWER: I didn't see this news, but if I'm not mistaken, January 11 coincided with the holiday time for us. I have no information that such a development has taken place. My friends ask about it and they give you information.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, will Turkey take any action before the Saudi Arabian authorities or the Organization of the Islamic Conference regarding the Hajj disgrace in Saudi Arabia? Is there an attempt to at least bring the bodies of our citizens who died there to Turkey, that is, not to use the Wahhabi method for them?
 
 ANSWER: You know, the regulations regarding Hajj are entirely under the responsibility of our Presidency of Religious Affairs. Therefore, the addressee of such questions is the Presidency of Religious Affairs. Of course, our Ministry also fulfills its duty of helping in the field of discussing and consulting with the relevant authorities about various problems within the framework of Hajj or the measures to be taken. Our relevant representatives are also involved in these activities. However, the real addressee of your question is the Presidency of Religious Affairs.
 
 QUESTION: Minister of State Kürşat Tuzmen has recently made a statement that oil products shipments from Turkey will be stopped as of January 21, if Iraq does not pay its debt. I wonder if there has been an announcement from Iraq that the debts will be paid during this time? Or if not, how will this decision be implemented, do you have any thoughts about it?
 
 ANSWER: Yes, there were some news on this subject in the press today as well. Our exchange of views with Iraqi and US officials regarding Iraq's debt of one billion dollars to our country and our initiatives with the relevant authorities continue. When we get results from these, we will have the opportunity to convey more comprehensive information to you.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the Prime Minister of Jordan was in Ankara yesterday and there was an information that was reflected in the newspapers yesterday. Uzanlar's companies are operating in Jordan. Can you confirm this information? Do you also have information in this direction?
 
 ANSWER: Your questions on this subject were answered by the highest authorities yesterday. It was also in the press today. Beyond that, I have nothing to say.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, there was a news that was reflected in the press again today. Since Norway does not recognize the EU terror list, it intends to continue its relations with the PKK. Could we get your opinion on this?
 
 ANSWER: In a press statement made by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 4, 2005, it was announced that Norway had previously supported the EU's list of terrorist organizations, and as a result of an evaluation made by the government, it decided to take the UN's list of terrorist organizations as a basis from now on.
 
 In the aforementioned statement, the reason for this decision is that continuing to support the EU's list of terrorist organizations will make it difficult for Norway to play an impartial role in various peace processes (such as Colombia and the Middle East), and that the inclusion of one of the parties in such a conflict on such a list will limit the possibilities of contact. It has also been reported that Norway, which is not a member of the EU, does not have a say in the EU's revisions on the list of terrorist organizations.
 
 As it is known, PKK/KONGRA-GEL, DHKP-C (DEV-SOL) and IBDA-C are also included in the EU list of terrorist organizations.
 
 We hope that this decision of Norway will not cause any change in its determination in the fight against the aforementioned terrorist organizations. In fact, all relevant decisions in the field of combating terrorism, especially the UN Security Council Resolution 1373, are among the most important regulations that create an international obligation to not support terrorism in any way and to take necessary measures to prevent terrorist activities.
 
 QUESTION: Beyond these wishes, have you had contact with Norway on this matter?
 
 ANSWER: They informed us about it. They informed us that this did not bring any change in their fight against the PKK and other organizations or their views on them.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw had a visit to Turkey and Cyprus towards the end of this month. However, in some news, it is said that this trip may be postponed or canceled because he wants to go to the TRNC. Will these trips be made? If so, can you give the dates?
 
 ANSWER: Since the preparations for this visit are still in progress, I cannot give information about where he will go, what he will do or what the program is. However, I will keep you informed about this in the coming days.
 
 QUESTION: Any progress on Condoleezza Rice's visit, which is expected to be in February? Because, due to Sharon's illness, there are some rumors that she will postpone her visit to the region.
 
 ANSWER: Again, you appreciate that these are questions that cannot be answered easily. Because it is clear that no one is in a position to know the developments in the region and Sharon's health at the moment. This visit is on the agenda, as we have said before. However, it does not seem possible at this stage to say when it will be done and what the program is.
 
 QUESTION: Since the date of Condoleezza Rice's visit is unknown, can a date be given for Iranian President Ahmadinejad?
 
 ANSWER: We have given you very comprehensive information on this subject as well. Such visits require a certain amount of preparation, as you all know. The administrators of the relevant countries, the state dignitaries have programs. The issues to be covered in these visits are linked to an agenda. Agreements or documents to be signed are prepared. This requires a process. Such a process has not yet been experienced with Iran. Of course, if such a process is passed and an agreement is reached on a date, the visit will take place. But such a process currently does not exist. The spokesperson of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also made a statement on this matter. Upon the question, he stated clearly that there was no question of postponing the visit, since even a date had not been set for the visit.
 
 As for the last point, a visit to Iran or from Iran to Turkey can have nothing to do with America or any other country.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, speaking of Iran, there are reports that the diplomats who met yesterday could not reach a consensus within the framework of Iran's latest decision. I wonder, Turkey, here …………..(not heard)
 
 ANSWER: ……….(not heard) We have conveyed our views to you in a broad framework, and beyond that, there is nothing to say at the moment.
 
 Let me mention one last thing. I thought maybe you would like to know a little about this. Tomorrow, as you know, our Minister will pay an official visit to Brazil upon the invitation of Brazilian Foreign Minister Celsor Amore. This visit is one that we attach importance to. As you all know, our Ministry determined an expansion strategy to Latin America in 1998, and within the scope of an action plan put into effect within this framework, high-level visits were made to the region and a series of activities were organized in order to improve our relations with Latin American countries. This strategy was continued intensively in 2005 as well, and it was decided to continue in 2006 as well. On the other hand, our Honorable Minister, every year, the trade, political relations, visits to ensure that bilateral and international issues are developed and strengthened. This year, this country has been identified as Brazil.
 
 In addition, Brazil is a candidate country for the full membership of the Security Council. As a country that has frequently taken part in the Security Council, its chances are also seen as high. We also have a candidacy for the UN Security Council Temporary Membership in 2009-2010. We will have visits and contacts in order to ensure both Brazil and its support at the UN. On the other hand, Brazil has put its signature under very effective works on many issues within the UN, from trade to environmental problems, from nuclear energy issues to resolving the problems in the Middle East. It has special relations with the Middle East region . Because people who have immigrated from the Middle East region live in the country. In this context, it has a close interest in the Middle East. As a country that carries weight in the region, it wants to continue working closely with our country on Middle East issues. It should be said that these works of Brazil were very effective. Especially the current Foreign Minister Amore's interest in the Middle East goes back to his time working at the UN. There was even an Amore Plan prepared at that time. Therefore, within the scope of its relations with this region, within the framework of Turkey's predominant role, Brazil is a country that attaches importance to cooperation with us.
 
 On the other hand, a large delegation of businessmen will accompany our Minister. Minister Çavuşoğlu will hold various meetings on increasing our trade, economic relations and mutual investments, as well as identifying various commercial, economic and technological projects to cooperate.
 
 As I said at the beginning, we believe that this visit is of great importance in terms of further strengthening the relations and cooperation between Turkey and Brazil, and we believe that this visit will make an important contribution to furthering our Action Plan for this region.
 
 I understand that you have no further questions, I thank you all and close our meeting."

 QUESTION: Namık Bey, TRNC Foreign Minister Serdar Denktaş was here the other day. He argued that the desired point has not been reached in the policies followed on the Cyprus issue so far and said that a new policy should be followed. He said that we will sit down and talk about this with Turkey. Do you have any information about this?
 
 No answer
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the reactions to the draft resolution on the Armenian genocide allegations in France are being evaluated. In this context, if the draft resolution is accepted, would Turkey consider withdrawing our Paris Ambassador, Mr. Osman Korutürk?
 
 ANSWER: I would like to give an answer within the framework of the general content of your question. In order to prevent the damage that the law proposal brought to the French Parliament on criminalizing the so-called Armenian genocide denial will cause in Turkish-French relations, the sensitivity of the issue on our side is brought to the attention of the French authorities at all levels. In our contacts, we emphasize that the restriction of freedom of expression and freedom of scientific research in a country like France, which has a strong democratic past, is incompatible with the understanding of democracy, and that the adoption of the bill may cause irreparable damage to the long-standing Turkish-French relations, and that this should not be allowed. On the other hand, in discussions about France's own history, high-level French officials, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, The statements that politicians and parliamentarians do not speak on issues related to history, that such issues should be evaluated by historians and that genocide and similar expressions should not be used publicly are in harmony with the thesis that we have been defending for many years. We expect the French authorities to show the common sense approach they have shown in the context of their own history, also within the scope of the baseless Armenian allegations. It is not possible for us to accept double standards and contradictory approaches in this regard. We expect the French authorities to show the common sense approach they have shown in the context of their own history, also within the scope of the baseless Armenian allegations. It is not possible for us to accept double standards and contradictory approaches in this regard. We expect the French authorities to show the common sense approach they have shown in the context of their own history, also within the scope of the baseless Armenian allegations. It is not possible for us to accept double standards and contradictory approaches in this regard.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, can you give some examples of initiatives? Will there be other talks on this issue beyond the Foreign Ministries? For example, will the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Parliament take the issue to their French counterparts?
 
 ANSWER: A series of contacts and a series of measures are on the agenda. I do not want to go into the details of these at this stage. As you can appreciate, an effort equivalent to ours is also shown by the French side. Therefore, it may be difficult for us to get an effective result if I explain the details of these studies to you at this stage by preventing them. In this regard, I think you will agree with me.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the EU Commission has adopted the fulfillment of certain criteria in order to open negotiations with Turkey on competition and public procurement. Will you have an opinion about it? Also, it was mentioned in the press that the Minister used a clear statement such as ""we will not open this school"" in his meeting with Bakoyannis regarding the opening of the Heybeliada Seminary. Did he use such a clear statement?
 
 ANSWER: This type of news appeared in one of our newspapers and in some press organs. I can only say that the kind of dialogue you mentioned did not take place between our Minister and the Bakoyannis.
 
 As for the EU issue, our EU negotiation process continues to the satisfaction of both the EU side and us. I think that both detailed and descriptive scanning have ended in 19 titles. As you all know, the negotiations are about to start in two chapters. The calendar of the next contacts and the process is also clearly known by the parties. Neither the Turkish side nor the EU side has a problem in this regard at the moment. As far as I understand, the issue you are talking about is the issue of ""benchmarking"". The Turkish side is also prepared in this regard; will do the necessary work. Everything happens in front of the public. Of course, this is a long and difficult road, as the authorities of the Republic of Turkey have emphasized many times from the very beginning. Of course, there will be some difficulties along the way. But there is mutual will to overcome them. We are of the opinion that the negotiations are proceeding very well and that the negotiations within this framework are carried out with a constructive understanding.
 
 QUESTION: Next week, you will host Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani. What specific messages will be given in this context? My second question is, is there a study in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the meeting between Prime Minister Erdogan and Iranian President Ahmadinejad in Baku or during the D-8 summit in Bali?
 
 ANSWER: As I said before, it would probably be better to get information from the Prime Ministry about the program of our Prime Minister. Of course, our Ministry plays a role in the preparations for this visit. However, it would be better to get information from the Prime Ministry regarding the content of the visit.
 
 As for your other question, you know we made a statement about Larijani's visit. He will come to Turkey next Monday. It is envisaged that he will meet with our Prime Minister, Dear Minister, and also with the Secretary General of the NSC. In fact, the message to be conveyed has been brought to the public's attention many times. We say it to the Iranian side over and over in every meeting. Namely: Iran has some responsibilities in the nuclear field. The foremost of these responsibilities is to be open and transparent. As a neighboring country, we will openly express our expectation and the expectation of the international public in this regard.
 
 QUESTION: Have you received any suggestion from the USA or Israel that this meeting should not take place, even if it is foreseen? Because if this has come, it has come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, please never forget that we do not schedule our visits according to the suggestion or advice of any country. If deemed necessary, we make all kinds of visits to everywhere, and we meet with everyone. However, it should also be said that as a friendly and ally country, we exchange views with the USA on many issues that are on the agenda of world politics, of course. Of course, we will continue to do so. Mr. Rice came here last. However, it is inconceivable that this should be related to the planning of the visit of our Honorable Prime Minister or any of our officials to any country or removing it from the agenda.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, a joint vision document was being prepared between the United States and Turkey. What stage have these studies reached? Also, there are different news as to whether the document will be signed or not. Will this document be signed by both parties at any level, or will it just come out as a document?
 
 ANSWER: We expect this document to be finalized within the next two weeks. Currently, studies and negotiations on this paper continue between the two countries. You mentioned different news about the signing of the document. We have stated very clearly in many places that it will not be signed. This document will not be signed. This document has no connection with any other agreements, contracts or similar documents currently existing between the two countries. It will be open to the public. It will not be a very long text. We will give you this document when the preparations are finished and it comes out.
 
 QUESTION: What is the reason for not signing the vision document? Should it be considered only as a political roadmap between the US government and the government of the Republic of Turkey? You said that it will not have anything to do with other agreements with America; I mean, can we accept this as an interstate document?
 
 ANSWER: It is already done between two states.
 
 QUESTION: Why is it not signed? Did the Turkish side want it not to be signed, or did the American side want it? Or is it a joint assessment of both parties?
 
 ANSWER: This is a common text. That is, it will be announced if an agreement is reached. Everything that is not in the document will or will not be included in the document with the consent of both parties.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, did you have any further contact with Baghdad after the note said to have come from Iraq regarding Turkey's military build-up on the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolian border? Do you have any contact in this direction with other countries besides Iraq?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, the security of a country comes first. Therefore, as we have said so far and will continue to express from now on, we take every precaution we deem necessary for the security of our country. As a matter of fact, our officials have stated that the latest measures taken in our border regions are no different from those of last year and that they are aimed at ensuring security there. As you know, Iraq states that it does not have the opportunity to take effective measures against the PKK. In this case, we have more responsibility. However, it should be underlined that we do not intend to exploit the existing security gap with different considerations. Everyone knows this too. Finally, I would like to emphasize what I said at the beginning: we cannot entrust our security to anyone.
 
 QUESTION: In this context, did you send a message to US Secretary of State Rice and Barzani?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, we have seen that there are some news on this subject as well. We have the opportunity to directly say what we are going to say to our interlocutors. In this context, what I have just said has of course been clearly expressed to the Iraqi administration. These are sensitive issues. It is in no way acceptable to adopt attitudes that will create speculation on such matters. We are already telling this to the authorities in Iraq that we deem necessary. I want to repeat what I just said. Of course, we exchange views not only with the USA, but also with other friendly and allied countries on issues that concern the regional and global agenda. It would probably be correct to look at the issue from this perspective.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey is engaged in some activities against the PKK on the Iraqi border in Iran. Is there any intelligence or information sharing between Iran and Turkey regarding these activities of Iran?
 
 ANSWER: Thank you for asking this question. There is a fine line there too. It is necessary to understand it well. It is this: There are border security cooperation mechanisms with Iran on this issue. Within this framework, cooperation is being made with Iran at the border to prevent organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorist infiltration. However, the issue of security is the responsibility of each country. Therefore, the measures that Iran may have taken or are taking against the PKK are being taken within the framework of the security of its own country. The subject of the existing border security cooperation mechanisms between us is cooperation at the border.
 
 QUESTION: It took place in the press yesterday regarding the Cyprus issue. A similar statement was made, ""If the USA recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, it will set a bad example for Turkey."" How do you evaluate this statement, especially when there is a topic like the PKK on the agenda?
 
 ANSWER: If I remember correctly, this statement was made by the Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos. These statements show how detached he is from reality and from seeking solutions. In fact, the more Mr. Papadopoulos speaks in this direction, the more he exposes himself.
 
 On the other hand, it is known to everyone that the Greek Cypriot Administration of Southern Cyprus has embraced PKK elements in Cyprus in the past. It should not be forgotten that the terrorist leader Öcalan was caught with a Greek passport. Presumably, when this issue came up, Papadopoulos must have remembered these issues, so he felt the need to talk.
 
 I understand that you have no further questions, thank you all, closing our meeting."
2006-10-05,5/10/2006,"10 Mayıs 2006, Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Namık Tan´ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı","May 10, 2006, Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Namık Tan",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/10-mayis-2006_-disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-namik-tan_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi-.tr.mfa,,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,PKK,0,0,"TAN: Dear friends, welcome to our press briefing today. I greet you all with love as always. Today I will not have any explanation. If you have questions, I'll try to answer them.
 
 ……
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Tan, Iran's Nuclear Negotiator and the Secretary General of the National Supreme Security Council Doctor Ali Larijani had allegations that the USA was meeting with the PKK during his Ankara visit. Various statements that he gave information, documents and photographs to Turkish authorities were reflected in the press. It is stated that Turkish intelligence also has such information. Did Mr. Larijani give you concrete evidence on this? Do you have such information?
 
 ANSWER: Essentially, necessary explanations were made by our authorities on this issue. In fact, this question was answered at the highest level. Larijani spoke of such an allegation. However, I have no information that he has given any concrete documents.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, Iraqi President Celal Talabani has some statements that Condolleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld allegedly gave to a television that he said, ""Turkey cannot do a cross-border operation."" Did Turkey give such an assurance to the American side or did it discuss such an issue with the Iraqi side?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, the Republic of Turkey takes its own decisions. The owners of the expressions in question know this very well. When it comes to the security of our country, we take every precaution without hesitation. The owners of these statements should be pleased with our fight against PKK terrorism. Because right now there is a serious security gap in northern Iraq and the PKK is exploiting this gap. If this situation continues, the PKK will become a great threat to Iraq as well. In this context, it should be underlined that Turkey does not have a hidden agenda regarding any of its neighbors, nor does it have any intention or policy to take advantage of the existing security vacuum in Iraq for different purposes, as we have emphasized before.
 
 QUESTION: With regard to Talabani's statements that he was assured, did you ask the US for information whether they said anything in this direction? Likewise, did you ask the Iraqi side a similar question as to where Talabani's words came from?
 
 ANSWER: I have expressed our position very clearly to you. Our stance is clear, it does not require anyone to ask for information or a comment.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, after the Canadian Prime Minister's declaration of genocide, our Ambassador to Ottawa came to Ankara and is giving consultations. It was started to be written in the press that there were some reactions to Canada, be it military or economic. I want to ask these, was there a reaction; Have such things been done? How do you see future relations with Canada?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, you all know that we have expressed our reaction to the Canadian Prime Minister's statements. An evaluation is taking place in our Ministry regarding the steps to be taken in this regard. I can also tell you that this evaluation is carried out in consultation with our other relevant institutions. At this stage, I think it would not be appropriate to go into detail beyond that.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Tan, in an article published in the Hürriyet newspaper today, while summarizing Turkey's policy regarding Iran without any reference to anyone in quotation marks, statements such as ""We will comply with the United Nations resolutions, we will not prevent this if an international coalition is established as in Iraq"". there is. Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs share such an opinion?
 
 ANSWER: Even if the subjects that you have not heard directly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are given in quotation marks, it should not be respected. The issue of Iran or similarly sensitive issues are issues that require further attention. We have explained our policies regarding Iran to you on various occasions, as clearly as possible. These are available in your notes. Therefore, they should be trusted.
 
 QUESTION: There are ongoing negotiations regarding the strategic vision document. How about these talks? So is there anything agreed upon?
 
 ANSWER: It is true, these negotiations are continuing. I also stated last week; I stated that we expect these talks to continue for another week or two. Therefore, we have a working period ahead of us. We will give you a statement after that. We will distribute that text to you as well. I want to emphasize once again: This text will not be signed; because there are various speculations. This text will be a public text. This text will be distributed to you when it is prepared and finished and when an agreement is reached by the parties.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, where is Minister Abdullah Gul planning to make his first trip by plane? For which month is it foreseen, is there any preparation? Secondly, what are the plans and preparations for the Tehran visit?
 
 ANSWER: Let's start with the second one if you want. No visits to Tehran are planned.
 
 As I mentioned before, our Minister's health condition does not allow him to travel by plane for a while due to the discomfort in his ear. I think it will take a few more weeks for that. Then, if allowed, he will travel by plane under medical supervision. It is not possible to predict where this trip will take place at this stage.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, these days the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria is expected to arrive. Also, the future of the King of Bahrain was announced. Could you give some information about whether these two visits will take place?
 
 ANSWER: I also remember that these visits were on the agenda. However, I am not aware of the details as of date. After the meeting, my friends find out and give you information.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, an agreement was signed between Turkey and the USA on the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I think there are some developments regarding this agreement. Could you give information?
 
 ANSWER: In order to provide the necessary expertise and technological support in order to make the export control system of our country, which is a party to all international regulations on the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, more effective, the ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the United States of America was signed on 14 June 2005 with the USA. Agreement on Cooperation to Facilitate Assistance for Non-proliferation Purposes” was signed.
 
 With the aforementioned Agreement, it is envisaged that the US will provide specialized training and technical equipment that will enable the identification of dual-use materials containing sensitive technology that can be used in the production of weapons of mass destruction to our licensing and implementing institutions in the field of export control.
 
 Our country is in a sensitive geography in terms of the spread of dual-use materials to undesirable users. With the entry into force of the agreement, it is aimed to provide specialist training to the personnel of our licensing and implementing institutions responsible for export control, and to equip some of our customs gates with technical equipment to help detect sensitive materials. Thus, the entry and exit of such materials beyond our control will be greatly hampered by stronger controls to be provided.
 
 US assistance will be provided within the framework of the US's ""Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance Program"" (EXBS).
 
 Within the framework of the said program, more than 40 countries, including Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia-Montenegro, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, Singapore, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Azerbaijan, are under export control and export control. It benefits from material and training assistance in the field of border security for the control of the border.
 
 The Agreement, which will be valid for three years, will have fulfilled its purpose by eliminating the above-mentioned shortcomings and will come to an end within the framework of the predetermined legal process.
 
 The operation and supervision of the system to be provided as a result of technical assistance will be carried out by our national authorities, and the contribution of the USA in this field will be limited to providing free technical assistance for the installation of the system and training on the devices.
 
 We will give you this statement in text at the end of our meeting.
 
 QUESTION: Could you give some information about Ankara's actions regarding this bill in France?
 
 ANSWER: We gave you a briefing yesterday, which contains very concrete information that we believe to be comprehensive. So, if you'll excuse us, let's not go into further details at this stage. Because it requires a process. We expect cold-blooded responses from all of you during this process. We are taking every precaution. The French administration also acts sensibly so that this bill does not pass the Parliament or become a law. It is our sincere hope that this bill does not become law. Because, while there is an environment in which our deep and historical relations, which we attach great importance to, will gradually develop, it should not be anyone's desire to cause some difficulties.
 
 Before ending this meeting, I would like to read a statement about the so-called ""Pontic Hellenism Genocide Monument"".
 
 We regret that the so-called ""Pontic Hellenism Genocide Monument"" was opened with a ceremony by the Mayor of Thessaloniki, Vassilios Papayorgopoulos, on 7 May 2006, as well as the participation of Government officials, Parliamentary Representatives and civil and military officials in the said ceremony.
 
 The claims of the so-called ""Pontic genocide"" have no historical and scientific basis and are merely a distortion of historical facts. We recommend that Greek authorities and academics evaluate historical events objectively instead of coming up with such discourses that will harm the relations between the two countries.
 
 In fact, we have been bringing our sensitivity on the subject to the attention of the Greek authorities for a while. On this occasion, we would like to reiterate our view that this step, which is the subject of allegations without any basis, does not comply with the spirit of cooperation and dialogue that we are trying to develop between Turkey and Greece.
 
 I close our meeting with this statement, I extend my love to all of you."

I welcome you to our press briefing today and offer my heartfelt regards. I want to explain two things to you. Israeli Foreign Minister Livni will arrive in Turkey on 29 May. Then, on 31 May-1 June, Russian Foreign Minister Mr. Lavrov will visit Turkey. We will make our explanations about these shortly. That's all I'm going to say. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them as well.
 
 ------------
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, is there any change in Bakoyannini's planned visit to Turkey on 10 June?
 
 ANSWER: As of today, there is no change.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, yesterday afternoon at noon, jets belonging to Greece and Turkey collided over international waters in the Aegean. Are there any new developments regarding the situation? My second question is, considering that yesterday NATO made a statement that Turkey is right, will Turkey apply for any compensation right? Will he seek compensation from Greece regarding the plane?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, there has been no striking new development in this regard since yesterday. If so, we will of course provide you with the most comprehensive information.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, how do you evaluate the election results in Southern Cyprus? A second question, Annan is sending Moller to the region; Is this a sign of a new quest? Any progress on Cyprus?
 
 ANSWER: I don't have any information about any progress on that issue. However, I would like to say a few words about the elections held in the Greek Cypriot Administration.
 
 The elections held in the Greek Cypriot Administration on 21 May 2006 are of special importance, as they are the first general elections held after the referendums on the Annan Plan on 24 April 2004, and also constitute an indicator for the Presidential elections of the Greek Cypriot Administration to be held in 2008. In the light of the results, the winners of the election were those who rejected the solution of the Cyprus problem. Another striking aspect of the election results is that the DIKO Party, headed by the Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos, increased its votes by 3.07%. Increasing the votes of this party in the elections, This points out that the rejectionist mentality has expanded its base in the Greek Cypriot Administration, albeit a little, and we estimate that the international community, especially the European Union Member States, are watching this alarming development carefully. Because when the election results are evaluated together with the surveys carried out by the Greek Cypriot Administration Statistics Institute a while ago, and it is taken into consideration that 61% of the Greek youth between the ages of 18-25, who are essentially voters in these surveys, declared that they do not want to live together with the Turks, it is possible to address the Cyprus problem within the framework of the UN. In terms of efforts to find a comprehensive solution, the Greek Cypriot Administration clearly displays the objector mentality.
 
 The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Administration and the people will evaluate the election results in the best way. These election results reveal that the Greek Cypriots once again rejected the partnership solutions that envisaged sharing power with the Turkish Cypriots.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, there are reports that some discussions broke out between soldiers and civilians at the coordination meeting held at the Prime Ministry regarding the ""Anatolian Fire"" exercise. Could you give us information about the content of these discussions?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have the slightest knowledge of such a discussion. As you all know, this exercise will be carried out tomorrow and the next day. We will watch this together.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, after the accident in the Aegean yesterday, the Greek General Staff claimed that the Turkish planes violated the air travel rules and crossed the Athens FIR line and did not give their flight plans. Do you have a reaction to this statement? What is the Athens FIR line; is it a valid line for military flights; Or is it just about civilian flights?
 
 ANSWER: Our views on all these issues are very clear. I don't want to create a new discussion thread again. You will all be watching in the coming days. We wish peace, tranquility, security and stability in the Aegean. We hope the same understanding exists on the Greek side.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, there was a project to establish a red line between the Greek and Turkish General Staffs. In some news originating from Athens, it is claimed that it started to work and was used yesterday. Can you provide information about it?
 
 ANSWER: This line has not started to work yet. However, we expect a concrete development in this regard in the very near future, before the first half of next month.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, a claim was made at the beginning of the week that the European Union Commission suggested that Turkey go to the EU Court of Justice regarding ports. Is there such a suggestion forwarded to you? If not, how would you view such a thought?
 
 ANSWER: There is no such issue on our agenda as you mentioned. The current issue on our agenda is the Action Plan dated January 24, 2006.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, how are the negotiations with the USA regarding the PKK presence in Northern Iraq? Can you give information about this? Could you give information about the latest developments regarding the Strategic Vision Document?
 
 ANSWER: Beyond the talks on the PKK, there has been no development that will bring a new dimension to the issue. But I can tell you this: It will probably be possible for the Strategic Vision Document to be announced to you before the end of next week.
 
 QUESTION: Has there been any development regarding the visit of Mr. Minister to America?
 
 ANSWER: There is no progress at this stage regarding the visit of the Minister to America. If there is any development in the coming days, we will explain it in detail.
 
 QUESTION: Who will attend the OIC meeting?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know, it is included in the program for the next month. We will tell you that later.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, there is a crisis in Iran because of a cartoon about comparing them to cockroaches in the regions where Azeri Turks are concentrated. Did you have any reaction?
 
 ANSWER: No, it didn't.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, regarding the conflict in the Aegean yesterday, the Greek press has a claim that Greece will issue a protest note to Turkey. Are there any protest notes sent to you?
 
 ANSWER: No, I do not have any information on this subject.
 
 QUESTION: Is there any contact with the Greek Ambassador in Ankara today?
 
 ANSWER: There is no meeting to my knowledge.
 
 My dear friends, I will finally give you the views of our Ministry on the outcome of the referendum held in Montenegro on May 21, 2006.
 
 In the referendum held in Montenegro on May 21, 2006 to determine the future of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, the people of Montenegro preferred independence. The referendum was organized in accordance with the rules set by the international community and was monitored by the OSCE.
 
 Turkey will continue to maintain its relations with Serbia and Montenegro in the spirit of close cooperation and solidarity as before.
 
 We hope that the results of the referendum, which we believe reflect the free will of the Montenegrin people, will contribute to the stability and prosperity of Serbia and Montenegro, and to the establishment of democracy and peace in the Balkans region.
 
 That's all I'm going to say today. If you don't have any other questions, we're closing our meeting here."
21/07/2006,7/21/2006,"21 Temmuz 2006, Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Namık Tan´ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı","21 July 2006, Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Namık Tan",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/21-temmuz-2006_-disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-namik-tan_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi.tr.mfa,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,PKK,0,0,"TAN: I welcome you to our press briefing today and warmly greet you all. I will not have any explanation. If you have questions, I will try to answer them.
 ------------
 
 QUESTION: There is a claim that Turkey and Iran carried out a joint operation against the PKK in some news reports today. Is there such an operation?
 
 ANSWER: There is no such operation. Turkey takes the measures it deems necessary by itself. We have a cooperation mechanism with Iran for border security and control of border crossings. Within the framework of this cooperation mechanism, we have a longstanding joint work with the Iranians. However, we do not have an operational cooperation.
 
 QUESTION: At the beginning of the week, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ali Tuygan had invited the Ambassadors of the USA and Iraq to Ankara to the Ministry and conveyed the expectation of taking concrete and decisive steps against the PKK in Northern Iraq. Has there been any response from Washington or Baghdad to this initiative and demand of Turkey?
 
 ANSWER: My dear friends, Turkey has clearly revealed its position on the issue you have mentioned, and the seriousness of the issue has been understood by everyone. We will continue our work within this framework. Turkey is ready and able to take any measures it deems necessary when it comes to its national security, within the framework of consultation and cooperation with all relevant institutions. This issue was also explained by the highest level and relevant political figures. There is political will on this issue; Necessary directives have been given to the relevant places and relevant institutions. This subject has technical dimensions such as intelligence, planning, timing. These are certainly taken into account. It is unnecessary to discuss these operational issues and to create some unnecessary expectations. You have to be very sensitive about this. We consult with our relevant institutions, We are making every effort to take every precaution in a timely manner for the security of our country. Our people should be sure and happy about this.
 
 QUESTION: There is an issue that the Minister also pointed out about the fight against the PKK. “The right recognized by international law.” Could you unpack this a little bit? What right does international law give Turkey to fight the PKK?
 
 ANSWER: This is well known to everyone. Turkey's right and law -as in every country- exists in the subject you have stated. There is nothing to discuss.
 
 QUESTION: Zapsu had various contacts yesterday. He has even been interpreted as the shadow Foreign Minister. As the Foreign Ministry, do you know that issues such as Israel, Iraq and Iran are handled by the consultant in consultation with the Ambassadors? Does Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul have any news? How do you evaluate these contacts?
 
 ANSWER: Necessary answers have been given in the framework of a question directed to our Prime Minister regarding the issue you have stated. So I have nothing to say about it.
 
 QUESTION: Don't you know?
 
 ANSWER: Of course, we have news, but as far as we can follow from the press.
 
 QUESTION: Can we get an evaluation on the fact that the terrorist organization PKK is not included in the list of terrorist organizations published by Russia? Has Turkey had any contact with the Russians on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: We had close contacts with Russia on this subject a long time ago. Our demands for the inclusion of this organization on the terrorist list on various occasions have been resolutely conveyed to them at almost every level. Our efforts in this direction continue. We will follow this matter. Russia has some technical hesitations. There is no doubt in Russia that the PKK is a terrorist organization. We hope that when the technical elements are eliminated, the result we want will be obtained.
 
 QUESTION: As you know, the Cabinet Decision on Saudi businessman Al-Kadi was canceled yesterday. One of them is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is involved. Will it be appealed, sir?
 
 ANSWER: The issue you mentioned is in the judiciary as you stated. It would not be right for me to make an assessment here about a subject in the judiciary. However, it is true, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey is the defendant in this matter. Of course, we will show the necessary reaction in the coming days.
 
 QUESTION: In order to clarify my previous question, is a cross-border operation outside of close monitoring a right recognized by international law? Secondly, in an interview with the Financial Times, Minister Çavuşoğlu stated that the PKK had acquired weapons in Iraq and the Iraqi army. If there is information on this, was it conveyed to the parties in the meetings of the Undersecretary? If so, how was the response?
 
 ANSWER: I just said it, my dear friends. This issue, in terms of the dimensions you have stated, enters into aspects of the issue that cannot be shared with the public. It is therefore impossible at this stage to be very specific on such matters.
 
 QUESTION: There are news that the UN-supported Geneva Call Organization has signed some agreements with the PKK and Kongragel on mine clearance. Is this organization, to your knowledge, an organization supported by the UN? What type of organization is it for you? Do you have any extradition attempts regarding those who signed this again?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, I would like to answer your question with a question. Will there be an agreement with any terrorist organization? Therefore, the signing or non-signing of such a thing or such a contact is null and void. There is no question of signing an agreement with a terrorist organization; though it has not the slightest validity.
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that some officials from Switzerland's Geneva Canton were also present at the signing ceremony. Have there been any attempts by the Swiss authorities? Has Turkey's discomfort been communicated to Switzerland?
 
 ANSWER: Necessary attempts have been made.
 
 QUESTION: There were news that a note was given to Iraq because the PKK opened an office in Baghdad. If there has been such an attempt, has any response been received from the Iraqi authorities? If so, is a process such as the closing of this office on the agenda?
 
 ANSWER: Our colleagues have been making statements to you on this subject for a day or two. But that is not the subject of yesterday or today. It's been going on for quite some time. We had made our attempts verbally at the time. Recently, we have given this in written form to the relevant authorities. We follow the subject. I think this office will be closed in due time.
 
 QUESTION: Israel's operation against Lebanon continues. We also know that Prime Minister Erdogan had some contacts on this issue. It's about Bush, Hariri and Assad. Is there any attempt by Ankara to open a security corridor and how do you evaluate the ongoing operations at this stage? When do you expect it to end?
 
 ANSWER: Our desire is to stop the conflicts as soon as possible and to restore peace and tranquility as soon as possible. Again, I strongly emphasize this point. If the conflicts are not stopped here, fire, blood, tears and hostilities will become very serious. We never desire this. This is also the view of our government. As a matter of fact, starting with our esteemed Prime Minister, our esteemed Minister and other political officials have all made the necessary statements in this regard. The continuation of conflicts creates a very unsettling situation in terms of fueling hostilities. It leads to the emergence of different understandings. This also adds to the complexity of the problem. Therefore, we take initiatives at all levels to stop conflicts and restore peace and trust. It would be correct to count the contacts of our Prime Minister within this framework. We have persistent attempts. We expect that the international community and the UN will respond to these calls as soon as possible and that necessary steps will be taken as soon as possible to establish peace and security and to stop the conflicts.
 
 QUESTION: Regarding Israel-Lebanon, there are discussions about establishing peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon. I think this issue was brought up in the meeting our Prime Minister had with Kofi Annan, although it was not very detailed. What is Turkey's principled approach? If such a power is planned to be established, would Turkey consider contributing here?
 
 ANSWER: In an environment where the conflicts continue so intensely, it is not possible to evaluate some initiatives such as the establishment of a peacekeeping force like you mentioned. First of all, the conflicts should stop and a peaceful atmosphere should emerge between the parties so that the issue you mentioned can be evaluated.
 
 QUESTION: Recently, an interview of the Palestinian Prime Minister was published in a newspaper. It says there, ""We are waiting for Mr. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Palestine in the near future."" I wonder if the Prime Minister's visit to Palestine or a visit from Palestine to Turkey is planned in the near future regarding Israel?
 
 ANSWER: There is no such visit that I know of.
 
 QUESTION: You said, ""We will show the necessary reaction on the issue of al-Qadi"". As far as I understand, in the decision of the Council of State, it is in question that the attached documents are not sent, that is, the documents of the UN regarding El Kadı are not sent. Will you show the necessary reaction, which will be the sending of those documents? Can you open a little bit?
 
 ANSWER: This is a judicial process. Whatever steps need to be taken in the judicial process, we will take them in the next process. There is a process. If I'm not mistaken, there is a 30-day period. During this time, we will evaluate and give the necessary response.
 
 QUESTION: It will be a more technical question, but you are a person with a legal education and background, maybe you can enlighten us. Now we have a decision taken by the UNSC and this decision is binding on governments. On the other hand, there is a decision taken by an administrative court in Turkey, which overturns this decision and requires that this decision not be implemented. Legally, technically speaking, will the frozen assets of Al Kadı be returned in violation of the Security Council decision, or will the decisions of the Council of State be implemented?
 
 ANSWER: Thank you for your words about my legal profession, I am honored. However, like every lawyer, I must have files. It would not be right to talk about a subject whose files I do not know. Moreover, I think many of you do not have this file. We do not know this file with its exact elements. Therefore, our lawyers examine this file in terms of its dimensions related to our own institution. It would be extremely wrong for me to make a statement that would prevent judicial decisions.
 
 I understand you have no further questions. I reiterate my sincere regards to all of you and close our meeting."

 QUESTION: Mr. Tan, the fight against the PKK is on the agenda. We see that the leaders in Iraq are giving some messages. For example, we understand that according to yesterday's news, the administrators in Iraq sent a letter to the PKK and called them not to take any more armed action. Is there any official information or concrete development given to us on this matter? 
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, as you all know, the PKK terrorism and the efforts to eliminate this organization are among the top priority mandates of our government, security forces and other relevant state institutions. The Anti-Terrorism Board carries out very effective studies in this regard. Within the framework of the program required by the decisions taken here and the measures envisaged, this issue is followed closely by Iraq and the USA. As all of you will have followed, our discomfort regarding the PKK terrorist organization's activities in Iraq has been brought to the attention of Iraqi authorities at every level and on every occasion, and will continue to do so. The Iraqi authorities have recently informed us about the measures they envisage to take regarding the cessation of the PKK terrorist organization's activities in Iraq. We expect these measures to yield tangible results as soon as possible and we are following this closely. Our security forces work very effectively within the framework of the directives given to them regarding PKK terrorism. You are following them as the elements of this struggle emerge and within the framework of the explanations made. This struggle will continue and as a result, the PKK terrorist organization will definitely and definitely be defeated, and we will soon see this manifest in a concrete way.

This struggle will continue and as a result, the PKK terrorist organization will definitely and definitely be defeated, and we will soon see this manifest in a concrete way.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, there is talk of a triple mechanism in similar reports. Could you give us some information about what this mechanism is, its working method or how it is constituted? 
 
 ANSWER: You are familiar with the previous meetings held within the framework of the tripartite mechanism that we conducted with the USA and Iraq. It is possible that these meetings will be held in the future. However, no decision has yet been taken in terms of timing. We are of the opinion that some concrete progress should be made in these meetings and the infrastructure should be well prepared. Both the US side and the Iraqi side are of the same opinion. For this purpose, we continue our work. I hope that when the meeting date is finalized, we will have the opportunity to inform you.
 
 QUESTION: In some media organs, it is stated that there is a standoff between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs due to Cüneyt Zapsu. Can you give me information about this? Is there such a cold?
 
 ANSWER: These are all fanciful news or stories written on a desk. We do not consider them important. It has nothing to do with reality.
 
 QUESTION: One of the news about the operations carried out against the PKK was under the title of “Plan to Liquidate the PKK” and it was claimed that some PKK senior executives would be sent to Europe. Is there such a bargain between your plans? In addition, there are news that Behram Salih and Safin Dizayn from KDP members, in their capacity as Deputy Prime Ministers, want or are coming to Ankara. Are these Iraqi news stories true? Did your contacts take place at this level?
 
 ANSWER: If there are concrete plans for the fight against the PKK, we cannot share them with you. You appreciate it. In fact, it is not possible for us to share any specific element of that struggle with you. These are activities carried out in a certain confidentiality and within a certain schedule and time. As for your other question, the representatives of any of the groups in Northern Iraq did not come here. It is not scheduled to arrive. However, you all appreciate that these are people who have relations with Turkey. They enter and leave Turkey on various occasions within a special framework. These should be met naturally. However, there is no formal planning. Yesterday, I tried to explain this to you as much as possible. Berham Salih, on the other hand, made a two-hour stop-over yesterday in Turkey during his journey to Europe and left. We have learned this on the basis of your questions. Ezcümle there is no one here to have an official meeting or contact with official persons.
 
 QUESTION: Of course, we do not expect a plan explanation; but the statements you just said show that you expect something to happen very soon. Is there any concrete information that has come to you, be it from the US or Iraq, that you have expressed that something may happen very soon because of this?
 
 ANSWER: By the parties involved, of course, I mean the USA and Iraq. Our close talks and consultations continue. We are in contact with them. Not only our Ministry, but all our relevant institutions are in contact with their counterparts within the framework of their own directives and authorities. Of course, we are speaking on the basis of knowledge.
 
 QUESTION: The news that Syrian President Bashar Esat wants to come to Turkey at the end of the month was reflected in the press. Do you have such a visit planned?
 
 ANSWER: None.
 
 QUESTION: The United Nations Security Council has taken a decision regarding Iran. After this decision, Iran announced that it would not stop its nuclear activities in line with the expectations of the UN. Could we get your opinion on that?
 
 ANSWER: I am not aware of that decision. But I can tell you this: Turkey has made very strong contributions to the activities towards a peaceful, diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear program. You've all watched this. If deemed necessary, we will continue to contribute.
 
 QUESTION: You said that the Iraqis conveyed their package plans to us. Were they found satisfactory for us? We understand that you do not want to go into details; but was it satisfactory? How do such steps from Iraq affect the government's decision to operate if necessary? Does that determination continue in the same way?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, please do not see the fight against terrorism as black and white. We are in a very sensitive period where concrete results may emerge within the framework of a cooperation that gets stronger over time. It is the absence of elements that can be followed from today to tomorrow. You all know this. Therefore, of course, since there are elements that do not satisfy us in general, we have reacted to the missing aspects until today. However, the stronger this cooperation continues, the sooner the tangible results will emerge. One of the countries we cooperate with is our ally and one is our close friend. Therefore, we expect tangible results from our cooperation with them to emerge in the near future. I have emphasized this strong expectation to you within this framework.
 
 QUESTION: One of the issues on the world's agenda is the operations of Lebanon and Israel. How do you evaluate Israel's ongoing operations and its failure to implement its own ceasefire decision?
 
 ANSWER: You are following closely. Turkey has also made significant contributions in this regard. You know, we made a statement strongly condemning the latest attack on Kana. The continuation of events in this way and the harming of civilians puts the issue in an increasingly difficult course. We are concerned about this. Our expectation is that the ceasefire is reached as soon as possible and the hostilities are stopped in order to determine the elements of the solution. We are making great efforts in this direction. You are all following our efforts in this direction. Minister Çavuşoğlu attended the meeting in Rome and made our necessary contributions there. Today, our Prime Minister will go to the meeting that is being held in Malaysia. There will be a comprehensive meeting organized by the OIC on the same subject. It is one of the top priorities of Turkey, as well as the international community, that this problem be calmed down as soon as a ceasefire is achieved and the hostilities end and progress towards a solution begins. You know, there is great suffering every day. This leaves deep traces in everyone's hearts; hostilities increase. We have been expressing this for a long time; We hope that the ceasefire will be achieved as soon as possible and we will make the necessary contribution in the process.
 
 QUESTION: We see that the leaders or foreign ministers of the countries that closely follow the events in the Middle East go to the region. Is there a visit at the level of Minister of Foreign Affairs or Prime Minister from Turkey to Lebanon, Israel and the countries in the region?
 
 ANSWER: No, there is no planned visit at this stage. I'll let you know when it does.
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that France is attempting to establish a military base in the Greek part of Southern Cyprus and Turkey opposes it. What's the latest? If France establishes a base there, what would it mean for Turkey? Could you give information?
 
 ANSWER: The allegations in the Greek Cypriot media that France and the Greek Cypriot administration will sign a military cooperation agreement are closely followed by our Ministry. As you know, security issues including military issues in Cyprus are regulated by international agreements. On the other hand, the Greek Cypriot administration cannot make commitments covering the entire island on any issue, we hope that all relevant parties will act by considering the sensitivity of the issue.
 
 QUESTION: There was a decision of the Council of State regarding Yasin El-Kadı. Have you received the relevant file? CHP Deputies released documents showing that Yasin El Kadı came to Turkey last year and engaged in commercial activities. Do you have any knowledge about this?
 
 ANSWER: In our last press conference, I expressed the issues that we need to explain about this issue. There was no further development to be added to these.
 
 Finally, our friends will send you a note about our emergency aid to Lebanon after the meeting. We think it will be useful for you in terms of information.
 
 I understand you have no further questions. I thank you all and close our meeting."

 QUESTION: Namik Bey, there is a news in today's Vatan newspaper. That Ahmet Davutoğlu, who was in the delegation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs during his visit to Syria yesterday, met with Hamas officials. Did this meeting take place?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, we answered your questions in this regard yesterday. At the highest level, our Honorable Minister also answered this question. We explained all our meetings, what we did. Other than that, I don't have any information to give you.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, it is said that the Minister is likely to make a trip to Iran within the framework of the latest developments in the Middle East. Is there such a trip?

 QUESTION: In the framework of Iran's response to P5+1, did the Minister have any contacts or any meetings planned?
 
 ANSWER: Our Honorable Minister has not had any contact on this issue. However, if you allow, we can briefly touch on this subject.

 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, will this visit be within the framework of a tour? Or will Annan only come to Turkey? Do you have any information in this direction?
 
 ANSWER: I personally have no information. However, I have heard that the Secretary General will also come here within the framework of a tour.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, we know that the Minister met with the families of 3 abducted Israeli soldiers within the framework of his visit to Israel. Could you give some information about this meeting?
 
 ANSWER: Yes, I can. Today, there is a lot of news that this is a secret meeting. I can tell you that these news do not fully reflect the situation. Israel is the party that wants a secrecy in this regard. On the other hand, it is Israel who announces this. I would like to draw your attention to this matter. This was not a pre-arranged meeting. Minister Çavuşoğlu received these families and their relatives at the hotel. There can be no question of our esteemed Minister or our Ministry refraining from knowing this. The families told our Minister that they are against the war, that they are very sad about what has happened, that they are very sad about the troubles of the Lebanese people, that they never approve of what happened, that their children are not even soldiers, that they are guards, They stated that they were not ready for war and asked our Minister for help in a humanitarian framework. Minister Çavuşoğlu stated that we would do all we could to free the abducted soldiers and prisoners in Israeli prisons. As you will remember, our Minister has also said this in front of the press in Israel. There is nothing hidden about it. They also stated that they would do our best to help these families within a humanitarian framework. There is nothing hidden about it.

After which meeting this came to the fore; How did the Israeli side want this to be included in the program?
 
 ANSWER: There, the Israeli authorities are our interlocutor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It reached us through them.
 
 QUESTION: I had one more question regarding the Meshal meeting. In the statement you just made, you mentioned that, as I understand it, Mr. Minister met with three people in Syria. But do you confirm here that Ahmet Davutoğlu did not meet with Halit Meshal? Or do you not say anything about it?
 
 ANSWER: I gave my answer to this question. It is not possible for me to say anything beyond that at this stage.
 
 QUESTION: Did you have any contact with Israel at any level after the meeting with the families was reflected in the media?
 
 ANSWER: It didn't.
 
 QUESTION: Isn't there a contradiction here somehow? How is this contradiction resolved? What is your comment, evaluation?
 
 ANSWER How is the contradiction?
 
 QUESTION : The contradiction is that the Israeli side does not want this meeting to be reflected in the press, but it is announced by them. How do you evaluate this?
 
 ANSWER: I told you how I evaluated it. If they want it to be known, then it must be known with all its elements. We told them what needed to be known.
 
 QUESTION : Namik Bey, Hezbollah is considered a part of Lebanon. Negotiations are made with all parties for the Peace Corps. Could a contact with Hezbollah be on the agenda?
 
 ANSWER: Within the framework of our contacts with all groups in Lebanon, within the framework of our contacts with the Lebanese government that represents them, of course, we also met with the officials of Hezbollah.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, President Bush made a statement. It is stated that the UN Force in Lebanon can be established with a new UN resolution, including disarming Hezbollah. Can we get your views on this? Is Turkey still of the opinion that ""we will not participate if there is disarmament""?
 
 ANSWER: Yes, that is quite obvious. Turkey does not accept a mission such as disarming any group or, to put it by name, Hezbollah. If such a mission is given, it is out of question for Turkey to contribute to a mission within this framework. Likewise, Turkey will not be in a mission that will require any conflict. The purpose for which Turkey will go there has been very clearly expressed on various occasions. If such a decision is made, it may be possible to send a humanitarian force that will carry out humanitarian aid activities and reconstruct its infrastructure.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, we know that some documents, especially the engagement document, came to Turkey from the UN recently. Do these documents meet Turkey's demands as a response you just gave?
 
 ANSWER: That document and many related documents are being examined. A technical evaluation is carried out. The results of these visits will also be included in these technical evaluations. I don't know how long this will last; But I don't think it will take long. Our decision will then be announced to you.
 
 QUESTION: We know that September 6 is foreseen for the arrival of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to Turkey. Is the issue of sending troops to Lebanon planned to be resolved before this date? Or is there a possibility of making a decision later in the talks with Annan?
 
 ANSWER: There is no such definite set of calendars for this work. We follow the developments. Whenever it is deemed appropriate, then the decision will be taken.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, UN officials said that none of the parties sent a text of objection to them regarding these documents. The message that this document is open to change can also be understood from here. I wonder if Turkey plans to create and forward any documents or points of objection to the UN?
 
 ANSWER: This process is already ongoing. We have a representation at the UN. Our representation is involved in such studies. It maintains all contacts with relevant UN agencies as well as other representatives there. All of these come to us and become part of the technical evaluation that I have just mentioned here. All your questions will be answered when the decision is made. Technical evaluation is still ongoing, our decision has not been taken.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Namık, what does the UN currently demand from Turkey to contribute to its military force in Lebanon?
 
 ANSWER: It is clear what the UN demands. The UN says that the Lebanese Armed Forces should enter a band of fifteen thousand people in a band of twenty-five kilometers, take over these areas from Israel, and then create an international force of fifteen thousand people, and this international force together with the Lebanese army should maintain peace and tranquility there, and demands in this direction. are found. However, it has many different elements. It is not possible to rely solely on this decision. Because there are some clarity in the decision. Everyone is looking for answers to these issues. It is making contacts in this direction. In time, the answers will emerge somehow. Everyone will decide.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I would like to ask a question about the documents I just asked. Do these documents contain a clear date for the UN Force to be sent to Lebanon?
 
 ANSWER: It doesn't.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, do you have any intelligence that Murat Karayılan is in Erbil and will go to Germany? There is also a claim that his extradition will be requested from Germany; Is there such a preparation; is it done?
 
 ANSWER: To the best of my knowledge, there is no such development.
 
 QUESTION: A US consultant had a statement such as “Turkey cannot object to the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq”. Can you say something to this?
 
 ANSWER: As you correctly stated, he is an expert from the USA. Our interlocutor is the US administration and its officials. Such experts are free to express their views. They just bind themselves.
 
 Thank you all very much and closing our meeting."

 QUESTION : Mr. Namık, the bill will come to the Parliament within the next week. It is planned that way. On the issue of soldiers to be sent to Lebanon, of course, if the Assembly approves, what is the stage of the preparations? Is there any clarification on the conditions of the Turkish union and what kind of units it consists of? Thank you.
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, as you know, our government has taken a decision on this issue and the assembly is in question. The draft is being prepared. The preparations for the motion are made with the relevant authorities. It has been explained to you on various occasions under which conditions our unit will go if a decision is made. There is no change in this. To go over it very briefly, we emphasized that there should be a UN Security Council Resolution. In the meantime, we said that we would not engage in any activity such as disarming any group or any armed force. We also stressed that we must be accepted by all parties present there. There has been no change in these. These conditions of ours are still valid and I emphasize that, if such a decision is taken, our union will go there for humanitarian purposes.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, will any number of soldiers be pronounced in the memorandum, which is still being written? Or will the government be authorized only for a certain period of time, like the previous resolutions?
 
 ANSWER: At this stage, I can tell you that there will be a motion like the previous ones.
 
 QUESTION: As a continuation of Osman's question, there was no clarity on the rules of engagement prepared by the UN. A report from the UN Security Council was expected. Did he come? That is, under what conditions does it respond, that is, under what conditions does it not respond?
 
 ANSWER: There is the decision numbered 1701. In this decision, the mission of the troops that will serve in Lebanon is specified. Based on this decision, we are thinking of sending our troops if the decision is taken.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the news that Turkish warplanes hit some targets in Northern Iraq took place both in the Turkish and foreign press. Can you give me information about this?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know anything about this. As you mentioned, these are some news in the press. I don't know where they came from either. I don't have any information that I can officially tell you.
 
 QUESTION: When it comes to the PKK, the USA appointed a Special Coordinator to fight the PKK. Is Ankara on the agenda to make a counter-appointment? Do you have a calendar ahead of you regarding the timing of this? Is there currently a plan for Ralston to come to Ankara?
 
 ANSWER: You will all remember what we thought of this officer. We put it in a statement we made recently. We declared that we welcome this. Our appointment will of course be made. However, if you notice, the USA waited quite a while to make its own appointment. He made several assessments. We continue with the same evaluations. We will notify a contact person when he emerges in the coming days, and of course we will explain to you who he is.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, it will be an addition to Osman's question. Will the interlocutor be a retired soldier like Ralston? Any clarity on this? Also, is there any information sent to Ankara about what exactly the Coordinator appointed by the USA will do? If so, can you share it with us?
 
 ANSWER: Actually, I shared this information with you. You know then, I'm sure you will remember, that America is a set of institutions, that it takes a certain time to contact these various institutions separately and that it brings with it a significant slowdown in business, however, if such a person is appointed, it will be necessary to ensure coordination between their own institutions and speed up the work. I told you you could take steps. The appointed representative will have such a duty. Therefore, we will probably tell you shortly after that, when we have finished our evaluation, what kind of person will be brought before him. This person can be anyone. So it can be civilian or military. No decision has been taken on that issue at the moment. We will let you know when received.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I would like to make an addition. So the coordination you mentioned will only include military issues? Or will it be a mission that deals with the wider humanitarian, social and economic dimensions of this struggle?
 
 ANSWER: This will be a coordination that foresees the fight against the PKK.
 
 QUESTION: He stated that he wanted to appoint a coordinator in Iraq. Any information on this? Is it possible to appoint a coordinator from Iraq? If so, what would be Turkey's reaction?
 
 ANSWER: I have no information that Iraq will appoint a coordinator.
 
 QUESTION: President Sezer said that he did not find it appropriate for Iraqi President Talabani to come at the Land Forces Command handover ceremony. The President said that I do not find the invitations made on my behalf appropriate. Has any invitation been made to Talabani on behalf of the President? Is such a thing possible without the knowledge of the President?
 
 ANSWER: I never interpret the words of our President. I do not have such authority.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, some information is reflected on the Progress Report to be published on October 24. There are some criticisms that Turkey has slowed down the harmonization process, especially in the implementation of reforms. There are also criticisms about Chief Negotiator Ali Babacan. That he did not come to Brussels. Did Ankara really slow down this process?
 
 ANSWER: We have been following the recent developments in the world together. What subjects should be focused on is already revealed in the course of events. As you all know very well lately, the Lebanon issue and the unrest in the Middle East are developing on a ground that occupies the whole world. Therefore, although our work in the direction of the EU continues at the old pace, unfortunately, it does not attract the attention of the press or other circles. However, the scanning studies continued. At the same time, with the opening of the Parliament, reforms will come to the agenda again. It is necessary to take swift steps in this regard. I do not see any slowdown in Turkey's determination to become a member of the EU and its determination to work effectively in the negotiations carried out in this direction. From now on, all of you, especially in this month,
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, you said that the American coordinator will ensure coordination between institutions and institutions. So what will be the full duty of the Turkish coordinator? You have explained the duty of the American interlocutor a little, but what exactly will be the specific duty of this person, unlike the duty of the Foreign Office or the General Staff?
 
 ANSWER: Of course, it will do a similar task. The appointed person will also have a direct contact. It will also be responsible for accelerating communication between our own institutions and carrying out more effective studies.
 
 QUESTION : The Spokesperson announced that the US coordinator would be subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our coordinator will also depend on you. Any clarity on that?
 
 ANSWER: At least I don't have any clear information about that. However, it will most likely depend on the State Department.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Namık, is there a consensus among all institutions regarding the appointment of this coordinator? Because we also see news that military circles do not look very warmly?
 
 ANSWER: While we are expressing our satisfaction on this issue, of course, we reflect the views of the entire organization of our state. I think it is not right to try to draw some conclusions from them.
 
 QUESTION: Regarding the coordinator that Turkey will appoint. Not America's appointee. In other words, military circles express the opinion that there is no need for such an appointment.
 
 ANSWER: I have never heard of such an opinion before.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey will announce an important decision regarding the Iranian nuclear program today. Can we get Turkey's expectations from you before this decision? And did the Minister have any contact? Or will it? Is there such a plan?
 
 ANSWER: Our Honorable Minister has not had any contact on this issue. But you all know that the Six are working on Iran's response, they are evaluating. It is understood that this review was made in terms of how Iran's response would meet their expectations. Our expectation, on the other hand, has been explained over and over; peaceful solution of the problem through diplomatic means. We have made an effort for this. You all followed this closely. We hope that this problem will eventually be resolved by a method agreed upon by both parties. In addition, the ElBaradei report is expected to be announced today. This report will naturally play a role in this process. We are watching the developments. I repeat, our expectation is that this problem will be resolved through diplomatic means.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, you said that we will see the results of the EU studies soon. Among these concrete studies, is there any work on sending a bill for the approval of the Customs Union Additional Protocol to the Prime Ministry and then to the Parliament? Isn't there?
 
 ANSWER: You pointed to a very specific aspect. There is no bill submitted to the Parliament by our Government on this issue.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, there was talk about the Minister going to Athens on 2-3 October or accompanying the Prime Minister on his visit to the USA. Is there anything clear about this?
 
 ANSWER: As far as I know now, Mr. Minister will go to Athens. Because this will be an official visit. Therefore, I am speaking with my current knowledge, they will not be able to accompany our Prime Minister.
 
 Yes, I understand that you have no further questions, I reiterate my love to you all and close our meeting."
2006-11-09,9/11/2006,"11 Eylül 2006, Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Namık Tan´ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı","11 September 2006, Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Namık Tan",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/11-eylul-2006_-disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-namik-tan_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi.tr.mfa,,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,PKK,0,0,"TAN: Dear friends, welcome to our press briefing today. As always, I greet you with sincere love.
 
 I have a statement to make about the burning of the car of Feyzullah Baran, Attaché of the Embassy of Athens. After that, I will try to answer your questions.
 
 We have learned with regret that the car of Feyzullah Baran, Attaché of our Embassy in Athens, was set on fire on 10 October 2006, around 04:30 in the morning, while it was parked in the Pangrati district, by breaking the glass and throwing flammable materials into it.
 
 As it will be remembered, the car of Ergin Soner, the Undersecretary of our Embassy in Athens, was the target of a similar terrorist attack on June 23, 2006, and necessary steps were taken by the Greek authorities. We are concerned that there have been two attacks on the vehicles of our Embassy members in the last four months.
 
 In the note conveyed by our Embassy in Athens to the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately after the incident, attention was drawn to both incidents that took place in the last period, and the Greek authorities were requested to launch an in-depth investigation to find the perpetrators of the attacks, and to increase security measures for our Embassy and its members.
 
 As is known, in accordance with the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the receiving state is obliged to ensure the security of its diplomatic representatives residing in its country.
 
 My explanation is just that. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, there is very little time left for the voting to be held in France. You said hopes were fading. Can you give information about the latest situation now? Also, how do you meet Jan Michael Thibaux's request for Turkish citizenship?
 
 ANSWER: As far as I can remember, I have given you as much detail as possible on this subject. There is nothing to add to these. You have made your assessments comprehensively. Finally, there has been no further development beyond these. When it happens, we will of course inform you in the widest way possible. As for your question on the other subject, it is of course their decision; impossible to say anything.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the coordinator of the United States of America's fight against terrorist organization is coming today. Iraq's appointed coordinator on the same issue is expected to arrive. If he comes, it will be the first trio meeting. What will be discussed? How will a roadmap be determined?
 
 ANSWER: We have made statements on this subject before. A tripartite meeting is not foreseen. This is somehow how it was presented in our press. A tripartite meeting is beyond our knowledge. It is true that General Raston will have contacts in Turkey. First of all, it is envisaged that they will meet with Mr. Başer, who is naturally their interlocutor. These meetings will be held at our Ministry today. It is in question that General Raston will be accepted by our Minister tomorrow morning. We will give you the necessary information on these issues after the meetings are over. The goal of the talks is known. I don't need to explain it either. But to sum it up in one sentence; Fighting the PKK effectively and expelling this terrorist organization especially from Northern Iraq and ending its activities there completely.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, Mr. Minister will be received by President Sezer today. Could you give some information about this meeting? What topics are on the agenda? There was also a news in a newspaper that the Minister will visit Athens next week. Is such a visit foreseen?
 
 ANSWER: The agenda of the meeting that our Minister will have with our President is not within my knowledge. If I find out about this, I will share it with you. Likewise, I do not have any information regarding a visit to Athens next week. However, a visit to Athens is on the agenda. Studies are underway to clarify the history of this. I do not have any information regarding the completion of these studies.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, I will return to the issue of special representatives of the fight against the PKK. I wonder if there was any contact between Turkey after the Iraqi side was appointed with the anti-PKK representative? We also know that the mechanism is tripartite, why is a tripartite meeting not foreseen at this stage?
 
 ANSWER: The mechanism is not triple, nor has it ever been. I have no information that a meeting has been held with the representative appointed by Iraq so far. However, there is no such thing as not meeting with this person if he/she wishes. Of course it can be negotiated. However, such a plan has not been made. That's what I was talking about. Essentially, the issue is handled by the special representative appointed by the USA. A tripartite arrangement is not foreseen. I tried to say this.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, the Spokesperson of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently reminded Turkey. In case you do not do these and these, you cannot enter the EU. How do you respond to such statements at a time when the Minister's visit is scheduled?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know which statements you are talking about. However, if I am not mistaken, the Spokesperson of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs made some statements that there will be a train accident in the EU within the last week. I even know that he made some expert remarks, such as that there is no train track outside the train station and that trains will not derail if we follow the railway line. I am amazed by these. Because Greece's specialty, as you all know, is plane crashes, not train crashes. I advise them to take care of them.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, before the critical vote in France tomorrow, Turkey's expectations are of course known; but in this process, both our Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister had one-to-one contacts; Is there any information that comes to you about the weather there usually before the vote?
 
 ANSWER: To put it very briefly, there have been attempts by the French government to oppose this issue, which we naturally follow with a positive view. The French Government is against these initiatives in the parliament. However, of course, it should be essential that this bill be completely removed from the agenda with a more effective study. In other words, such a proposal should never have come to the fore. In a country that lays the groundwork for free thought, it is expected that such issues should not even come to mind. From this point of view, we hope that the French will get rid of this with common sense.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, while EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn was in Ankara, said that they expected Ankara to implement the Additional Protocol, which will extend the Customs Union to include Cyprus, in the EU negotiation process, without delay, in order to avoid a train accident caused by the Cyprus problem. Was there an initiative regarding the protocol before this protocol was sent to the Parliament? Does Turkey maintain its position at this point?
 
 ANSWER: There is no change in Turkey's position. However, I would like to remind Ms. Olli Rehn and EU officials that they have very serious responsibilities. This is not a job to be carried out with one-sided responsibility. The EU side also has responsibilities. First of all, they are expected to fulfill those responsibilities. They have undertaken these responsibilities themselves.
 
 It is essential to remove the isolation on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is the EU that started the work in this direction. No results were obtained. It is out of the question for us to take a stand or meet their expectations before these responsibilities are fulfilled.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Namık, there are meetings between Turkish and Armenian diplomats in Vienna from time to time. At this point, have there been any developments that will lead to any change in the condition of Armenia's withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh regarding the opening of the border gate?
 
 ANSWER: Some time ago, we sent you some information, albeit limited, about the content of these developments. Subsequent developments are beyond my knowledge. But I try to learn, I will give you information.
 
 I understand you have no further questions. Thank you all, I close our meeting."

 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, we know that the EU Term President Finland's proposal has been evaluated by the parties. Finally, TRNC President Talat held meetings in Brussels, TRNC Foreign Minister in Ankara, and TRNC Presidential Undersecretary Pertev in Finland. What is the point reached in these evaluations? What kind of evaluations, what kinds of opinions are on the table? What are the parties talking about; What is he bargaining for? There's a lot of speculation. We would be glad if you could give us some enlightening information.
 
 ANSWER: Due to the Cyprus issue, which is not actually an element of the technical process in the Turkey-EU accession negotiations, Finland has made some suggestions to ensure that the port issue is no longer an issue. You all know this. These unwritten proposals of Finland are being evaluated within the framework of our Action Plan. During the discussions on this issue, it is primarily aimed to clarify the proposals. In this context, it is aimed to correct the elements that are seen as unbalanced. As we have repeatedly stated, the addressee of these proposals is the TRNC. The Turkish Cypriot approach to the proposals is of central importance. In this context, Raşit Pertev, Undersecretary of the Presidency of the TRNC, is meeting with Finnish authorities in Helsinki on this issue today. We hope that the Finnish proposals will be further clarified as a result of these talks. For this purpose, we have adopted a constructive understanding in our contacts. We are of the opinion that the main place of solution of the Cyprus issue is the UN, which is tasked with this task in terms of a comprehensive solution. However, the proposals put forward by Finland in the EU, or some regulations developed within this framework, can be seen as very important steps towards a comprehensive solution. However, it can never replace the comprehensive solution. Finally, the proposals put forward by Finland in the EU or some regulations developed within this framework can be seen as very important steps towards a comprehensive solution. However, it can never replace the comprehensive solution. Finally, the proposals put forward by Finland in the EU or some regulations developed within this framework can be seen as very important steps towards a comprehensive solution. However, it can never replace the comprehensive solution.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, as you said, these suggestions have never been put into writing until today. What kind of explanation do the Finnish authorities make to you about this? Why isn't it written down? Considering the time constraint, it is stated that a solution should be found before the EU Summit in December. I wonder when these will be put into writing; Have the Finns made any statements about this?
 
 ANSWER: It would not be right to emphasize the time factor in such an important issue. Of course, we primarily aim to hold a negotiation that can be accepted in all respects, be beneficial to both sides, constitute the essential elements of the solution, and will yield a truly meaningful result as a result of the negotiations of the two sides. Therefore, we do not emphasize the time factor. Of course, they will answer first why the Finnish side has developed such an attitude. However, you know, when these are put on paper, they leak or are leaked to both the public and other authorities through the press, and eventually cause some prejudices. The Finnish side may have acted in this way with considerations arising from this.
 
 QUESTION: You said that the Finnish side's proposals need to be clarified. What is the downside of these suggestions; So what topics should be opened?
 
 ANSWER: We have brought these to your attention several times. We've outlined what's going on. Of course, it is impossible to go into details. These are issues that are still under discussion. However, the opening of both Maraş and Famagusta Ports, as well as the opening of Ercan Airport to international flights; As a result of all these, there are some elements such as the opening of ports and airports. These are sensitive elements. We discuss these in a constructive manner; We will continue to meet with the same understanding from now on. Our aim is to find a just solution to the Cyprus issue. A comprehensive solution will not emerge as a result of these negotiations. However, an important and positive step in that direction will be taken. At the same time, it will be possible to find answers to some of the issues that are emphasized in terms of the EU.
 
 QUESTION: You said that the main addressee of this proposal is the TRNC. In this framework, I wonder if the negotiations regarding the plan are foreseen between the TRNC or the Greek Cypriot side; Or is a quadruple meeting with the participation of the guarantor countries, namely Turkey and Greece, is envisaged?
 
 ANSWER: Our Action Plan answers such questions. In fact, these meetings are mainly evaluated within the framework of the Action Plan. Our goal is the emergence of a reconciliation between the two communities. We have said that if Turkey and Greece, which we can call the motherlands, also need contributions, we are ready to do that as well. This is in the Action Plan. Issues related to the methodology of the negotiations are not addressed at this time. However, if the evaluations we made within the framework of the Action Plan are accepted by the other side and other elements are found to be worth discussing, then the negotiations will be bilateral or quadruple, but the most important thing is the agreement of the parties on the island.
 
 QUESTION: You said that there were some unbalanced elements in Finland's proposal. Can we accept the fact that Ercan Airport, which you mentioned while answering the previous question, is not included in the Finnish proposal as one of these unbalanced factors?
 
 ANSWER: It can.
 
 QUESTION: Another issue. Is it within Ankara's assessment as an option that the issue can be resolved before the Court of Justice or the World Trade Organization?
 
 ANSWER: Such matters are not on our agenda at the moment. The work we are doing now, as I have just mentioned, is to ensure that the parties on the Island meet as soon as possible and we take a stance according to the atmosphere and line that will emerge as a result of these negotiations.
 
 QUESTION: Iraqi Foreign Minister Hosyar Zebari made a statement. Neither Iraq nor the USA can undertake any operation against the PKK. He even said that closing the Mahmur camp would not be on the agenda. Iraq appointed a coordinator; The USA appointed a coordinator. Doesn't the fact that Iraq's Foreign Minister makes such a statement, that an operation against the PKK is not even on the table, that the closing of the Mahmur camp is not on the agenda does not mean that the mission of the coordinators has come to an end?
 
 ANSWER: We also follow Iraq's internal security problems closely. Due to the fact that the authority and security in this country have not been fully determined, the problems continue as we all watch and know. However, as Turkey's border neighbor and a member of the international community, Iraq has obligations in the fight against terrorism. It is not possible for Iraq to evade these obligations. The issue discussed here is terrorism. The fight against terrorism is one of the top priorities for Iraq and other members of the international community.
 
 In addition to the statements of the Iraqi Foreign Minister, you know, a statement was made by the Iraqi Prime Ministry on 18 September 2006. Here, Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki emphasizes that within the framework of the recognition of the PKK as a terrorist organization by many countries and that the Iraqi Constitution does not allow terrorist organizations to shelter on Iraqi soil, the Iraqi government has decided to end the PKK's presence in Iraq, close its offices and block all its activities. While looking at the statements, it is absolutely necessary to evaluate the very clear statements of the Prime Minister. Major UN,
 
 QUESTION: Recently, the arrival of the Iraqi Prime Minister in Turkey was canceled due to a sandstorm. I wonder if a new date for this visit has been clarified? I also have a question: A report on the effectiveness of Iran and Syria in Iraq was published in the US Congress. It was also in the press today. What is Turkey's assessment on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know anything about that report. I don't know what you mean by Syria and Iran's involvement in Iraq. However, I can say that the Iraq issue is one of the most sensitive foreign policy issues for us. We are following all discussions on this issue very closely. The developments there are really worrying. We don't just say this. It is the common opinion of the international community. It is necessary to take more decisive and more appropriate steps by taking the views of the countries living in the region and knowing the region well, and taking measures in this direction as soon as possible. We expect this. At the same time, we express these views to our interlocutors by emphasizing them on every occasion.
 
 QUESTION: A decision has been taken in the National Parliament in France. After this decision, it was said that political measures could be taken. Mr. Minister also said in the Parliament. I wonder if there are any postponed visits, bilateral visits to France? The Minister said that Turkey could take some legal measures. Are there any developments or preparations in this regard?
 
 ANSWER: You said that a decision was made in France. No decision has yet been taken in France. In France, a bill is being passed from the Parliament. We have explained to you over and over at every level how much this bothers us. Here, the hearts of all Turkish people have been broken and France has lost its privileged role in the eyes of Turkey. It is not possible to fix this by law or administrative decisions. For this, France should have taken the necessary steps long ago. We have given them very friendly warnings and suggestions on this matter. Perhaps a point of relief to some extent is the French government's opposition to this bill. However, this does not solve the problems; It does not heal the wound in the hearts of the Turkish people, the Turkish nation. We expected a prudent action in this area from France and befitting the French acquis on freedoms. However, we are really very disappointed in this regard. France will probably have to live with this shame from now on, perhaps forever.
 
 QUESTION: Is there a postponed visit?
 
 ANSWER: Not as far as I know.
 
 QUESTION: Is there any idea to invite our Paris Ambassador to Ankara for consultation?
 
 ANSWER: No, we have told you that we do not have such an idea. This should not be perceived as a weakness. Because, our country's representative must be present in order to effectively deliver the views I just conveyed to you. There are many other ways of response. Again, as you all know, some are steps taken; some of them are steps that are considered to be taken. We are in the process; this should not be forgotten. It would not be right to answer this process starting from the end already. We are in favor of acting calmly and rationally, and in this way we strive to improve our steps and strategy.
 
 QUESTION : Troika meeting was held in Luxembourg. Did the Finnish Presidency make some suggestions or commitments regarding what topics can be opened in this meeting held after the screenings and its calendar? Because there is an assessment that actual negotiations will not start unless the Cyprus issue is resolved. I wonder if any calendar could be obtained from Finland?
 
 ANSWER: We did not see the European Union in such an approach. You, too, have watched the press conference on television. They also shared this with the public. We have seen that they do not have an understanding that Cyprus should be included in the process as a condition, and this is our expectation. Cyprus should not poison Turkey's negotiation process. This would be extremely wrong for the EU as well. The Cyprus issue is of course handled within the framework we have just mentioned. We have no problem in discussing this with the EU. However, the negotiation process is separate. The framework and parameters of the negotiation process are extremely different. It is very wrong to stipulate these two processes together. Things that can be seen as a condition in Turkey's EU process, you know, are the Copenhagen political criteria. In this context, we can of course be asked questions; our shortcomings; what is expected of us can be expressed. However, such an approach in the context of Cyprus is wrong and does not fit into the EU understanding.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I saw a news in some newspapers. It is written that a PKK terrorist, who is wanted by Turkey to be extradited and sought by Interpol, was released due to a technical reason, such as the indictment not being translated into Filamen during the Dutch judicial process. Has Turkey contacted The Hague on this matter?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information about this news you are reading. It is a very specific issue. We will investigate it through our friends, we will answer you.
 
 QUESTION: A note was given regarding the attack on the vehicles of our diplomats in Athens. Any results from this? What is the progress in terms of who the attackers are or increasing the security measures?
 
 ANSWER: Again, I have no information on how this was answered. I'll have to research that too, and I'll let you know after that.
 
 It seems that you have no further questions. I thank you all and close our meeting."

 …………..
 
 QUESTION: The President of the European Commission Barroso has made statements that the reforms are slow and the negotiations may stop. Will you have an answer to that?
 
 ANSWER: We cannot agree with these views of Mr. Barroso. As you all know, there is a very systematic and rapid development in the technical process in the negotiations with the EU. Scanning was completed in 35 titles. As you all know, negotiations have been opened and closed on one topic. The Assembly was called for an early meeting for the ninth reform package. A very fast and comprehensive study is being carried out. You will soon see that many progress has been made. The determination of our government on this issue is obvious. I can tell you that there is not the slightest weakening in our determination in terms of the work of the Turkish side.
 
 However, if it is desired to accelerate this work and to ensure that certain issues are quickly overcome, then the EU should also fulfill its responsibilities. The EU has very serious responsibilities in this context. The EU has so far shown no commitment to take any steps regarding these responsibilities. As a matter of fact, lifting the isolations on the TRNC is a responsibility of the EU itself. The appointment of the Commission by the Council on April 26, 2004, after the referendums, and the preparation of two regulations on the lifting of isolations as a result, are in our memories. Unfortunately, these regulations have been seriously deformed by the initiatives of the Greek Cypriot Administration; completely lost its meaning. In this process, the EU, in a way, had to bow to the pressures of the Greek Cypriot Administration.
 
 QUESTION: Turkey, within the framework of the Finnish Presidency's attempts to overcome the Cyprus problem, conveyed the views that it deems lacking in the proposals. I wonder if any progress has been made in terms of meeting Turkey's expectations in line with these views?
 
 ANSWER: As you said, we have set our expectations in appropriate ways. Currently, the management of this business depends on the efforts and work of the Chairman of the Board, Finland. We have stated to the Finnish Term Presidency and other interested parties that we are ready to contribute to these studies with a constructive approach. The responsibilities I just mentioned are also relevant to this issue. Unfortunately, the obstacle in front of this issue is the EU's insistence on not taking any steps regarding its responsibilities that I have just mentioned, or its submission to the pressures and prevention efforts of the Greek Cypriot side. If these can be overcome, it is possible that there will be very rapid developments in this issue. We conduct our contacts with the same understanding. We take a constructive approach. However, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Finland, the Presidency of the EU, stated at the last troika meeting in Luxembourg, tango is done with two people. The statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs clearly reveals the fact that both parties are aware of their responsibilities for the solution of an issue and show their willingness to take steps to fulfill these responsibilities. We will maintain our constructive approach. After that, if the same approach comes from the other side, it will be possible to overcome the problems.
 
 QUESTION: Does this constructive understanding include the transfer of all or part of Varosha, 20% or another percentage, to the UN? My second question is that the allegations about the Consulate General of Mainz took place in the press yesterday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had requested information from the Consulate General regarding this issue. Any progress on that?
 
 ANSWER: I gave you information about our stance on Varosha. Varosha can be a part of the comprehensive solution. So there isn't much to say about it.
 
 As for the allegations made within the framework of the recent events in our Mainz Consulate General, these are being investigated by our Mainz Consulate General by requesting information. As I said before, there has not been any inspection report or inspector review on this issue. We will examine this issue in detail. If the incident has a dimension that requires investigation, we will definitely do it. However, you should all know that there are some procedures and methods in state affairs. These procedures, methods and processes need to be followed. We are at such a point now. We will definitely give you explanatory information on this subject. However, the events need to be clarified a little more in our eyes. Is this true or not; Or is it just an allegation? All this needs to be understood. It takes some time to understand.
 
 QUESTION: Has the date of the postponed visit of Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki been determined?
 
 ANSWER: Not clear yet. We are working with the Iraqi side on this issue. We are working to make this visit happen as soon as possible. When it is finalized, we will definitely inform you about it.
 
 QUESTION: Will a delegation from the Kurdish groups in Iraq come to Ankara? There was also news in the media in that direction. Like KDP and PUK.
 
 ANSWER: I have not received any information on this issue.
 
 QUESTION: Do you expect an official from the regional Kurdish administration to be included in Maliki's delegation? Is there any information given to Ankara on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: Our interlocutor is the Iraqi government. The future Prime Minister of Iraq. We cannot interfere with how he will shape his delegation.
 
 QUESTION: What developments occurred after the collision of the F-16 aircraft? What is the current situation? Also, Mr. Chief of General Staff Büyükanıt will go to Greece. The Minister also had to go to Greece; was delayed. Is there any progress on this issue; Has the date been set?
 
 ANSWER: There is no progress. We have provided you with very clear and comprehensive information on this subject. After that, of course, we will keep you informed.
 
 It is in question that our Minister will go to Greece. However, there has not been any finalization on this subject yet. We'll let you know when it happens. We value our relations with Greece, as you all know. We wish to take these relations further by ensuring the strengthening of friendship ties and bilateral cultural relations in a warm framework. You all know the work we do for this purpose. What we want is strong, peaceful, solid and stable relations. We will continue to take steps in this direction.
 
 QUESTION: There is a lot of news in the press about the President of Yimpaş Holding. On the legal situation between Germany and Turkey. Do you have anything on this subject? Can't the Turkish judiciary do anything to someone who has victimized so many citizens?
 
 ANSWER: As you all know, our Ministry is not the addressee of that issue. You should investigate it from the relevant ministries or authorities.
 
 QUESTION: Could you give some information about the Minister's next term program?
 
 ANSWER: Our Honorable Minister will have some overseas trips or visitors coming here in the coming period. In general, I can convey it to you as follows. Between 31 October and 2 November, Minister Çavuşoğlu will pay a visit to Moscow for the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting. On 8 November, the Turkish-Italian Forum will be held in Rome. Our Minister will attend this meeting. It is in question that a meeting on the Inter-Civilizational Alliance will be held in Istanbul on 12-13 November. The participation of our Honorable Minister in this event is also being evaluated. The Turkish World Summit will be held in Antalya on 17 November. It is in question that the Euromed meeting will be held in Tampere on 27 November. NATO Summit will be held in Riga on 28 November. It is possible for our Minister to attend here. Finally, A meeting is scheduled for November 30 in Amman within the framework of the Broader Middle East Project –GODKA-. Here, the presence of our Honorable Minister is being evaluated. In short, this is the schedule for the next month.
 
 I understand you have no questions. Thank you all very much, I close our meeting here."

As always, I greet you with sincere love. I will make a statement regarding the use of the one million dollars allocated to Palestine by the grant agreement. After that, I will try to answer your questions, if any.
 
 As you all know, the grant agreement of 1 million USD, which envisages the use of grants on a project basis to the Palestinian National Authority, was signed on 10 July 2006 between the Palestinian Economic and Social Cooperation Coordinator Vehbi Dinçerler and the Palestinian Ambassador to Ankara Nabil Maarouf in the presence of Abdullah Gül, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister. . In the intervening time, studies have been carried out regarding the implementation of the agreement and the identification of the projects.
 
 Finally, on 29 November 2006, at a meeting attended by our Ministry and TIKA officials, Mr. Dinçerler, taking into account the needs and demands of the Palestinian side in the use of the grant, a resource of 1 million dollars was provided for the reconstruction of the three bridges destroyed in Gaza and the needs of the hospitals in Gaza. It has been decided that 15 ambulances will be donated to the projects. It is calculated that 500 thousand dollars will be spent per project for the repair of bridges and ambulance projects. 
 
 On the other hand, projects in which approximately 350 thousand dollars remaining from the first grant agreement of 900 thousand dollars signed on 21 December 2004 will be used were determined at the said meeting. In this framework, the project of training Palestinian health personnel in our country for a short time and the Palestine Culture Week activities that the Palestinian Embassy in Ankara envisages to be held in our country will be supported. In addition, resources will be allocated to the restoration of water dispensers from the Ottoman period in Masjid Aqsa and the establishment of cultural centers in the Ottoman palaces in Palestine.
 
 Turkey's support for the economic and social development of the Palestinian people will continue.
 
 If you have questions, my explanation is just this, I'll try to answer them.

 QUESTION : Namık Bey held a press conference yesterday with German Chancellor Merkel and French President Chirac together with the Polish President. In this meeting, some expressions about Turkey's EU membership process were used. How do you evaluate the statements and what will be your next goal.
 
 ANSWER: Dear friends, as you know, there have been many developments in this framework in recent days. If you allow me, I would like to make a short assessment that will cover all these and will in a sense provide an answer to all of them. 
 
 It is not right to interrupt Turkey's relations with the EU, which spanned more than 40 years, and we do not expect that the current process will lead to such a result. Neither Turkey nor the EU deserves a result such as interruption. The measures that will cause the entire negotiation process not to work are actually disturbing many members within the EU. As a matter of fact, the strongest reactions come from within the EU itself, as you may have all followed soon. Europe is on the eve of making a strategic decision regarding its own future and what kind of Europe it should be in the future. We understand that the last steps are the result of some developments in this framework. We act responsibly because we realize the importance of this situation. Ultimately, we believe that the EU will take decisions by seeing the strategic picture and thinking big.
 
 Every attempt is made by our government to bring about such a result. An intense diplomatic negotiation process continues. Our Honorable Prime Minister and Minister and other interested parties held many telephone conversations with their interlocutors. From now on, they will continue to meet with their interlocutors in the same line. We explain some of them, some we cannot. In short, I would like to say that whatever is necessary is being done to ensure that the decision goes well and does not make the negotiations impossible. In this context, everyone should be at ease.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, while the Prime Minister was evaluating yesterday's developments at the Esenboğa airport before his departure to Syria, he said that the foreign ministers will also come to Ankara. Is a visit to Turkey by the Foreign Minister of France or Germany foreseen? There was a problem with France because of the law that made the denial of the so-called Armenian genocide a crime. In this context, while there is such a problem, are there any initiatives in France? To support the EU process? Are you in contact with Paris?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have a concrete timetable for the Ministers of some European countries to come to Turkey, at least in the near future. However, my friends will ask this for you from their respective departments and we will reply you in a short time.
 
 Of course, our contacts with France and all other member countries will continue, as they have done so far. The EU issue is a very different issue. What you're talking about is beyond that. Of course, we hold talks with all countries in the most intense way and in a way that will reveal our views in the most open way. Do not forget that the EU is going through a painful period, as I have just said. We accept this with understanding and we are conscious of it. Of course, the EU will fulfill its responsibilities in overcoming this painful period. I repeat once again, I'm sure they will make big decisions.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I am asking you to understand better. What is the difference between the statement made at the tripartite meeting and the proposal to grant an 18-month grace period or respite, which was previously written in the newspapers? That is, one is more massive than the other. Or, according to some comments in the newspaper today, is it to persuade Turkey to suffer from malaria by showing death like this? Which do you think? It is said that yesterday's proposals are softer than the others' 18-month respite. Do you agree with this view?
 
 ANSWER: You know, the date of the EU council meeting is 14-15 December. This meeting should be your goal as well. Until then, of course, EU countries are carrying out various negotiations and consultations both with us and among themselves. It would be very wrong to take any of these as a cross-section and to judge and interpret them. I told you at our previous press conference as well. It would be very wrong and misleading to make firm judgments on details and to weigh them with firm judgments. We believe that the EU will definitely think big in a way befitting it.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul recently met with Ross Wilson, the US Ambassador to Ankara. We are used to the fact that the USA intervened in such periods, a similar process was experienced on October 3 in a similar crisis. We are again in such a crisis period and does Turkey have any expectations from Washington regarding the EU process? In particular, the EU has a reaction to the involvement of the USA in such processes. Will Ankara-Washington relationship be a reflection of Turkey's EU process?
 
 ANSWER: You know, our relations with the USA are very comprehensive. We discuss and evaluate almost every issue with the USA. Therefore, the EU issue is, of course, an issue that we consult and discuss with the USA when necessary. The USA is our friend and ally. Naturally, we will discuss such matters with them. In this context, what they will or will not do before the EU is of course their business. It wouldn't be right for me to comment on that.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, speaking of the US, there are some requests for the deployment of American soldiers in northern Iraq by the Kurdish groups here, and we have been seeing some movements there recently. How do you evaluate these? Does Turkey want American troops in northern Iraq? Do you think there is such a need?
 
 ANSWER: Actually, we have expressed our views on this issue on various occasions. Our pursuit in Iraq is peace and stability. This is the realization of peace and stability in unity, in a country with political integrity. For this purpose, we have given all kinds of support to Iraq and will continue to do so. Anything that will cause divisions, divisions and conflicts in Iraq will harm regional and world peace. We do not want this, and when some signs appear in this direction, of course, we express our discomfort to both our interlocutors and those who lead such initiatives in Iraq. We hope that everyone will act responsibly regarding the political unity and integrity of Iraq and that Iraq will find peace as soon as possible.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey was in the Radikal newspaper today. That Turkey will put into effect a new plan if the EU takes a negative decision. That it will suspend relations to a certain extent. Do we have a decision not to discuss strategic issues with the EU, especially Cyprus, if a negative decision is made? Can you say that if their attitude towards Turkey changes, Turkey's attitude towards the EU will also change?
 
 ANSWER: I ask you to forgive me for making the choice not to evaluate this issue. Because, as I have just stated, it would be extremely wrong for us to respond to the judgments you have stated at this stage or to put forward our own strategy. Today, everyone is striving to make a strategic decision, a product of great thought, on 14-15 December. This is done by some members of the EU and also by some circles in Turkey. Now, while this process is still going on, it is wrong for us to make judgments or put forward our evaluations or explain our strategy within the framework you have stated. So excuse me for not being able to do that.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, some statements of Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki were reflected in the press yesterday. Maliki said that they are considering holding a meeting that will bring the neighbors together for security and stability in Iraq, and that he will send envoys to some neighboring countries, which he did not name. I wonder if Ankara expects any ambassador from Iraq in this context? Have you received such information?
 
 ANSWER: I did not receive such information.
 
 QUESTION: I would like to mention the injury incident that occurred in our Baghdad Embassy. I can't remember the name of the al-Qaeda member who was caught in August and was responsible for the Istanbul bombings in the police and intelligence reports. It was documented that he made threats against our Baghdad Embassy, ​​and then such an injury occurred. How exactly did this injury occur? As portrayed in the press? And how is the situation of our Third Secretary? I guess the reporters at the hospital couldn't find him. Did he leave the hospital or how do we want to know the situation?
 
 ANSWER: We actually gave you a pretty detailed explanation on this subject. To repeat the main elements of this, Özcan Şahin, the Third Secretary of our Embassy in Baghdad, was injured as a result of a bullet, called a tired bullet, in the garden of our Embassy, ​​on 2 December 2006, at around 16.00, within the framework of the incident you mentioned. This has nothing to do with an event within the framework you mentioned. The incident occurred as a result of a bullet coming across our colleague, who was walking around with his friends in the garden of the Embassy, ​​within the framework of the conflicts in the region.
 
 QUESTION : It is known that there are high protective walls in the garden of the Embassy and how does a bullet falling from the air hit the waist ? There is also the case of the capture of al-Qaeda members in Hatay yesterday. Has al-Qaeda threatened our embassy in Baghdad?
 
 ANSWER: Please do not confuse the two events. Since we are already vigilant when such threats or security risks arise, all kinds of precautions are taken. This has nothing to do with it. As a matter of fact, you said that your friends could not meet this colleague. Because he received a very short treatment and was discharged. His health is very good, there is no problem. We have always been very vigilant about the security of our colleagues, representation and agency staff in Iraq, and we will continue to be so in the future.
 
 QUESTION: Does the government have any preparations for implementing the Customs Union Additional Protocol? At what level the EU expects? Is there a calendar preparation for such a preparation? What is the calendar for you?
 
 ANSWER: I cannot say that I fully understand your question. However, if the implementation of the Additional Protocol means the opening of ports and airports, this can only be evaluated as a result of the lifting of the isolations on the TRNC, as you all know. Otherwise, we will not be able to take a unilateral step.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I would like to ask a question about Lebanon. There is a serious government crisis in Lebanon right now. First of all, do you see this crisis and the possibility of the sectarian conflict in Iraq spreading to Lebanon? Second, while the Turkish soldiers were deployed to Lebanon, all channels in the government, especially Hezbollah, were negotiated. But at the moment, Hezbollah is not in the government. Is it possible to review the position of Turkey's soldiers there and UNIFIL from now on? Third, as far as I know, the Prime Minister is expected to make a visit to Lebanon after Syria. Is such a calendar currently set?
 
 ANSWER: Our Prime Minister's visit to Lebanon is in question. I cannot tell you the exact date of this. Because I do not know. However, the issues you mentioned are the issues that Turkey has always followed closely. Developments in Lebanon, Iraq, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, developments in Syria and within this framework the contributions that Syria can make or can bring to the process are on Turkey's agenda. We evaluate these issues every day and deal with them with our interlocutors. As a matter of fact, our Prime Minister visited Iran and is visiting Syria today. All these issues that you mentioned are covered. There, in part of your question, you brought up the issue of the security of Turkish troops. We are also very sensitive in this regard. If a situation arises where our soldiers may be in danger, we will of course meet with our interlocutors,
 
 QUESTION : Namik Bey, Palestinian Prime Minister İsmail Haniye has started to visit the countries of the region in a surprising way lately. These visits started with the green light of America and Israel. He met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Egypt and the President in Syria. After that, he will go to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran. Could it be possible for him to come to Turkey within the framework of these visits?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information that such a request has been made or that such a visit will take place.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, I had two questions. First, the Dutch soldiers serving under the supervision of the UN handed over Bosniak Muslims to the Serbs in Srebrenica and gave medals of honor to the soldiers who were alleged to be guilty of the massacre that followed, causing a serious reaction both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Islamic world. I want to know what are Turkey's evaluations on this issue? Secondly, there was a telephone crisis during the Prime Minister's visit to Iran at the weekend. Regarding this, I wonder if Turkey had a diplomatic contact or an initiative with Iran? Thank you.
 
 ANSWER: In July 1995, the biggest massacre of the Bosnian war took place in the city of Srebrenica in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was declared a “safe zone” by the UN Security Council resolution 819/1993. Between 12-16 July 1995, 8 thousand Bosniaks, mostly men, were massacred in and around Srebrenica.
 
 The one responsible for the atrocities in Srebrenica is shown as the international community, which could not intervene in time and take the necessary measures. In UN Security Council resolution 1004/1995, “Bosnian Serb forces” were called to withdraw from the region. In the United Nations' Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, the events are described as ""massacre"".
 
 An investigation was opened by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan about the aforementioned event, which caused some doubts about the mandate of the UN Peacekeeping Force. As a result of the said investigation, some new changes had to be made in the job description of the UN Peacekeeping Force. Our sadness has been expressed on every platform because of the inhumane events that took place in Srebrenica.
 
 
 As for the issue of interruptions in mobile phones in Iran, as you may have followed and some of you have written, during the visit of our Prime Minister to Iran on 2-3 December 2006, an outage in the mobile phone (GSM) network occurred and Turkey Although Turkcell had a ""Roaming"" agreement with Iran, they could not use their mobile phones in Iran.
 
 As a result of the research carried out by Turkcell's Iranian representative with the Iranian GSM operator, it was learned that the problem was caused by a technical malfunction caused by a ship breaking the fiber optic cables connecting Iran to Dubai and passing under the Persian Gulf. Work is still in progress to fix the mentioned defect. Until the fiber optic line was reactivated, another routing was provided on the evening of 4 December 2006 so that Iran's GSM network could be connected to the world, and the problem was temporarily resolved.
 
 The interruption affected not only Turkcell's service but also the service of other European GSM networks in Iran. During this period, it was determined that the French and Italian mobile phone networks did not work in Iran.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, there are reports that General Ralston, the USA's Special Representative for Combating the PKK, will attend a meeting in Europe with Turkey's Special Envoy for Combating the PKK, General Edip Başar. If possible, inform us about this meeting. What is the content of the cooperation between the two countries has come to what point.
 
 ANSWER: I have not heard these news.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, THY had a very interesting event yesterday. Despite being found not guilty, 4 Turkish citizens accused of being members of Al Qaeda in Pakistan were not allowed on the THY plane. How do you evaluate the fact that Turkish citizens are not allowed on the THY plane, and was this done with the knowledge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information about the incident you are talking about. I need to research this issue. I can only inform you after the meeting.
 
 
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Namık, during the Prime Minister's visit to Iran, there was news that a memorandum of understanding on the natural gas issue was being worked on. Are the details of this clear? When will it be announced? Also, during his visit today, I wonder if the President of Syria will convey a special message to the Prime Minister?
 
 ANSWER: I don't have any information about what kind of conclusions were reached on technical issues. My friends research these issues from their respective departments, ask questions and give information. As you know, it would be better to get some information and evaluations from the Prime Ministry regarding the visit of our Prime Minister. The question you asked about his visit to Syria can also be evaluated in this context.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, you know that the USA is preparing for a political change, a tactical change in Iraq. It is also known that there is a working group on this subject and this working group also prepares a report. Is it possible to evaluate the Prime Minister's visits to Iran and Syria within this framework? Because, it was known that in the report of this working group, Iran and Syria also made suggestions to discuss the Iraq issue with the USA.
 
 ANSWER: The visit of our esteemed Prime Minister has nothing to do with the preparations of the report you mentioned. Of course, our own evaluations and Turkey's point of view have been discussed within this framework. These are the visits made to contribute to this. I assume you are referring to the Hamilton-Baker report. We are closely following the developments in that regard. We will evaluate the outcome within this framework and determine our policies accordingly .
 
 QUESTION: It will be a continuation of our friend's question, but there is a meeting of neighboring countries with the initiative of Turkey. So there is an ongoing process. While there is such a process, I wonder whether Turkey wishes more narrowly to meet between Iraq, Iran and Syria, or more broadly, to continue the meetings of these neighboring countries.
 
 ANSWER: As you know, the Neighboring Countries of Iraq meetings are Turkey's initiative. Of course, Turkey would find it more appropriate to make a comprehensive evaluation within this framework. However, this does not mean that the countries in the region will not be able to meet among themselves or that Turkey will not meet with the countries of the region at a bilateral level. Of course, such talks will continue. These are the most natural mechanisms of international relations.
 
 Yes, it seems that you have no questions, I greet you all again with love and close our meeting."

 We regret and cannot understand that the said proposal, which states that Turkey's accession negotiations with the EU should not be interrupted based on prejudices, included a series of unrealistic and distorted statements that were not compatible with the constructive approach behind this statement.
 
 In the accepted text, reference is made to the so-called ceasefire call of the terrorist organization PKK/KONGRA-GEL, our citizens of Kurdish origin are described as a minority, the need for a political solution to the so-called Kurdish problem is expressed, models are suggested for its solution, and the solution of this problem is that Turkey should be a part of the EU process. recommendation to the Italian Government. We expect that these recommendations, which we consider as the product of a distorted approach, will not be taken into account by the Italian Government.
 
 Referring to the so-called ceasefire call of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL terrorist organization, which took the lives of 35,000 citizens of the Republic of Turkey, is on the EU Terrorist Organizations list and whose members are on trial in various European countries, this resolution is on the agenda with domestic policy motives and circles that ignore the excellent course of Turkish-Italian relations. Our dissatisfaction with the fact that it was brought and accepted by a body of the Italian Parliament was conveyed through the invitation of the Ambassador of the Italian Republic in Ankara to our Ministry and through the initiatives made by our Ambassador in Rome before the Italian authorities."

 The agreement regarding the participation of the Russian Federation in the Operation Black Sea Harmony entered into force with the exchange of notes between Deputy Undersecretary Ambassador Rafet Akgünay and Interim Charge d'Affaires of the Russian Embassy Elbrus Kargiyev. Thus, in order to deter and prevent asymmetrical risks that may arise in the Black Sea, the Russian Federation has officially been included in the Black Sea Harmony Operation, which has been carried out by our Naval Forces Command since 1 March 2004.
 
 Operation Black Sea Harmony is open to the participation of all Black Sea coastal states, and essentially other coastal countries have been invited to participate in the Operation simultaneously.
 
 In this context, Ukraine has come to the stage of signing the protocol for participation in the Black Sea Harmony Operation, and Romania has taken a decision at the political level regarding participation in the said Operation.
 
 If you have questions, my explanation is only this, I will try to answer them.

 QUESTION: Mr. Namık took part in the Turkish press today, with reference to the American press. It is stated that with the democrats taking over the majority in the American Congress, the possibility of enacting a resolution on the Armenian genocide has become stronger. How do you see these comments and what is the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs doing to prevent them?
 
 ANSWER: We also observe that such expectations emerged in Armenian circles after the elections held in the USA in November. As you all know, the relations between Turkey and the USA are multidimensional and strategic. It covers very comprehensive topics. In this context, we are sadly watching the efforts of the Armenian lobbies and Armenian circles to exploit the political developments there in search of a kind of vote hunting. The US administration has so far taken a very prudent approach to such efforts. We believe that the US administration will continue this approach in the future. The relations between Turkey and the USA are of importance far beyond some such small calculations. We cooperate with the management on this issue in a very comprehensive and beneficial way. Necessary information is provided at all levels. Of course, we will continue our efforts in this direction in the future as well. We expect the USA to maintain its prudent approach in the upcoming period. We have no doubts about this.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, there are reports in the press that there has been no news from the artist Tarkan's brother Hakan Tevetoğlu in Afghanistan for about three days. Have you received any information regarding this? What kind of contacts does the embassy have for this?
 
 ANSWER: I have no concrete information on this subject. However, as far as I have learned; Our representative there has been informed about this issue. They will make the necessary attempts in the coming hours. We will inform you when the result is received.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, it is known that there was a meeting jointly organized by the Shiites in Iraq this Monday in Mecca, and there are reports that neighboring countries were also invited, but only Turkey was not. How does Turkey evaluate this issue?
 
 ANSWER: Dear friend, a few days ago we made the necessary explanations to you on this matter. You know this too. There is nothing to add to them at this stage.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey, the UN Security Council has decided to impose some sanctions due to Iran's nuclear activities. Can I have your comments on Turkey's approach to this? Regarding the UN resolution and Iran's reaction to it?
 
 ANSWER: We have given you detailed information on this subject in a timely manner. We respect UN resolutions. You all know this. In this framework, we will determine our policy in the coming period. You know, our contacts at all levels regarding Iran's nuclear project have been within the framework of the diplomatic solution of this problem with Iran and will continue to do so from now on.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey, you know that the death penalty of Saddam Hussein, the ousted leader of Iraq, was approved. Will we have an opinion on this?
 
 ANSWER: As we have repeatedly explained to you, our priority in Iraq is the peace, security and stability of this country. You all know about our efforts in this direction. Our expectation to act by taking all these into account has always been strongly expressed. As we have said from the beginning, this issue is an internal matter of Iraq and has emerged within the framework of its domestic law. It is not possible for us to interfere or intervene in this and make any comments beyond that.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namık, there was a call from the Iraqi Parliament to organize a conference for the Kurds in Turkey in Iraq. Could we learn the evaluation of the Turkish Foreign Ministry on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: I don't quite understand your question.
 
 QUESTION: A call was made in the Iraqi Parliament. To organize a conference on the situation of Kurds in Turkey. I think this call was made yesterday and it is stated that there was talk about setting a date for it one day. What is Turkey's stance on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: Will this meeting be held in Iraq?
 
 QUESTION: Yes, it will be held in Iraq.
 
 ANSWER: As you can see, I have no knowledge on this subject. We create our own policy and of course we never want others to interfere with our policies.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Namik, I know that many conferences have been mixed together, but it is on the agenda for Syria to hold a conference on Iraq again. According to the news from Damascus yesterday. In fact, contact was established with Turkey and Turkey said that we can join. Do you know of such a conference?
 
 ANSWER: No, but as you know, our neighboring countries initiative is still in effect. In this context, if I am not mistaken, 9 meetings have been held so far. From now on, we will continue our efforts in this direction.
 
 QUESTION: Namık Bey sent an invitation letter under the title of EU-Turkey negotiations. with regard to industrial policies. Has this invitation letter reached Ankara and has Turkey's response been communicated?
 
 ANSWER: It is true, the letter has reached us. Our negotiation position document has been requested. We continue our work in this direction. But as you all know, this is not a call that lives up to our expectations. We were expecting a call to be made under the four titles that were ready. We hope that the EU will take more concrete steps in this direction in the coming days.
 
 QUESTION: Namik Bey met with our Foreign Minister, Former Prime Minister of Iraq, Allawi. He said he had a plan to save Iraq. He gave the message to Ankara to meet with Barzani and establish a dialogue. What was Ankara's support for Allawi's plan? Another question I have is that there are some criticisms of Barzani in the press today. It was previously owned by Jalal Talabani. It's about Turkey's meddling in Iraq's internal affairs. How do you evaluate the accusations regarding Turkey's meddling in Iraq's internal affairs?
 
 ANSWER: Turkey does not even think about meddling in Iraq's internal affairs. I have just explained our expectation about the situation in Iraq to you. Our only desire is to establish peace, tranquility and trust in Iraq, to ​​establish a government that is at peace with itself and at peace with its neighbors, and its continuation in stability. Beyond that, we cannot interfere with anyone's internal affairs or other affairs. We never thought of such a thing. We haven't done it yet. However, developments in Iraq are closely related to Turkey. Turkey cannot remain indifferent to these, cannot be a spectator. Because we feel the heat of the fire in Iraq. Therefore, we continue our work not only as Turkey but also with all neighboring countries in order to support the Iraqi administration in order to solve these problems and to settle them as soon as possible. It will be like that from now on. There can always be some voices from inside Iraq. This is our approach. We also respond to them in this context.
 
 QUESTION: I would also like to ask the proposal of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia to establish indirect diplomatic relations with Turkey. After all, do we have a policy of dialogue on this issue? Or is it not an important diplomatic event for us?
 
 ANSWER: Recently, we have been seeing some statements originating from Armenia and the Armenian administrators. Both the statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the article of the Minister of Defense are some statements in this direction. However, I would like to say the following on this subject - we have explained before - last year, our Prime Minister called on Armenian President Koçaryan and proposed the establishment of a joint commission of historians with the participation of Turkish and Armenian historians to conduct studies on the investigation of the 1915 events. However, due to the negative approach adopted by Armenia regarding the aforementioned proposal, no concrete progress has been achieved in this regard. It will ensure that the differences in interpretation of the Joint History Commission about the 1915 events are eliminated, We think that it will be an extremely useful mechanism that will take on the function of confidence building between the Turkish-Armenian peoples and thereby remove an obstacle to the development of relations between the two peoples. In this context, we do not doubt that the joint history commission will make an important contribution to the normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. Turkey is determined to establish a zone of peace, tranquility and stability around her in line with traditional foreign policy principles. In this framework, it maintains its desire to establish relations with Armenia as it should be between the two neighboring countries. We intend to continue our efforts to normalize our relations with Armenia. naturally, Our achievement of these efforts will depend on Armenia's more flexible and constructive approach to overcoming existing bilateral and regional problems, and acting in accordance with international law. We should evaluate the latest statements of the Armenian Minister of Defense and the statements of the Minister of Foreign Affairs within this framework.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Namık, there was a news from Brussels in a newspaper. Accordingly, Finland and some countries, including England, Spain and Italy, are said to have proposed that 8 titles, which were frozen and decided not to be discussed at the moment, could be opened immediately in return for Turkey opening one of its major ports to the Greek part. Has such an offer reached Turkey? Or is this just leaked information? And of course, what is Turkey's position?
 
 ANSWER: We have not received such information.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Namik, what is the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the deportation of Armenian-born Turkish citizen Bedikyan from Azerbaijan? We know that information was requested from Azerbaijan. Any official response from them? Have you received any information?
 
 ANSWER: It is true, we asked the Azerbaijani authorities for information on the subject you mentioned. We have not yet received the result of this initiative. We'll let you know when we get it. Our attempt has not yet been answered.
 
 
 Yes, I understand that you have no further questions, as always, I greet you all with the most sincere love and bid you farewell with the most sincere feelings. I send my love to all of you and hope to meet you again in another medium."

 As a result of these efforts, we learned that the Iraqi Security Forces carried out some checks in the aforementioned camp yesterday (17.01.2007) and that the Coalition military officials took part as observers during the operation. We welcome this information.
 
 In line with our expectation that the PKK/KONGRA-GEL terrorist organization will end its presence and activities in Iraq, we hope that these steps will continue in a fruitful manner.
 
 The Mahmur Camp should be closed, and for this purpose, the PKK's presence and pressure in the camp should be ended, and an environment should be created where our citizens living in the camp can freely decide about their future. We consider the operation, which was reported to have been carried out yesterday, to be the first step in this direction."

The main target of these cowardly attacks is the bond that holds the Muslims together as brothers. Unfortunately, it is feared that the death toll may even rise higher. 
 
 Our greatest hope is to see those days at the earliest time, when sectarian violence is ended, terrorism is eradicated and common sense prevailed, thereby ending the suffering of the Iraqi people. 
 
 To this end, Turkey is determined to intensify its continuing efforts aimed at the welfare and happiness of the Iraqi people; and is committed to increase its cooperation with the Iraqi Government in this context.

As you know, many important visitors came to Turkey recently. I'm sure you will have questions. I have no press releases or statements to make today. That's why we can go directly to your questions.
 
 ……………
 
 QUESTION: There is a statement made by the Prime Minister in Riyadh. He said that Turkish diplomats could meet with British soldiers detained in Iran today. Do you have any comments or evaluations on this subject?
 
 ANSWER: I did not see the statement of the Prime Minister; but I can say something about this. Yesterday, as you know, the British Foreign Secretary made an official visit to Turkey. During this visit, within the framework of the meetings with our Minister, the issue of the detention of British soldiers by Iran came to the fore. By the way, I think the British Foreign Secretary also gave direct information to the press. During his time in Turkey, he had a meeting with his Iranian colleague. He did not provide us with detailed information about his meeting with the Iranian Minister directly. But as far as I know, the British side requested that the soldiers be visited by the British diplomatic mission representatives if possible; It has come to the agenda that if this is not possible, a third country may undertake the mediation. He also told us about it. Minister Çavuşoğlu also stated that if we could help in this matter, we would gladly do so. But right after that, as far as I know, there was no development. However, our Prime Minister naturally has more up-to-date information. It is necessary to take the statement he made as the basis.
 
 QUESTION : Tariq Hashemi, the First Vice President of Iraq, was here yesterday. I will ask for information about the meetings. Also, did Mr. Hashemi convey any message from the Iraqi administration regarding the Extended Iraq Meeting planned to be held in Istanbul? I have one more question. There have been some news that the Cyprus condition has been introduced regarding the purchase of the F-16? Could you give some information on this subject?
 
 ANSWER: Let me start with your second question. As you know, F-16 purchases are made within the framework of military cooperation agreements. They have specifications. At the moment, I do not have any information about what kind of issues are included in this specification. But we are investigating this issue; If possible, we'll get back to you about it this morning.
 
 Today, I can share with you the following about the visit of Tariq Hashimi, Vice President of Iraq: As you know, Iraq and Turkey, as two neighboring countries, are in close dialogue and contact with each other. Very high level visits are made frequently. In the past days, you will remember, another Iraqi Vice President came to our country; had contacts. Again, I'm sure you will remember, three Iraqi Ministers, Minister of Planning, Minister of Electricity and Minister of Water-related issues were in our country on the occasion of a meeting held in Istanbul recently. We have always stated. To reiterate, we are in very close dialogue with Iraq as our neighbors. In this context, Vice President Tarık Haşimi also paid a visit to our country.
 
 Some questions came; I would like to respond to them on this occasion. There was no particular reason for the visit. Normal contact should be seen as consultation. He had a meeting with Mr. Minister. He met with our esteemed Prime Minister and our esteemed President. I can emphasize that all issues were discussed in the interviews. In this context, how the general security problem in Iraq could be improved came to the fore. The Vice President gave us detailed information about the Iraqi Petroleum Law. The economic dimension of Turkey-Iraq relations came to the fore. How to diversify economic relations was discussed. Apart from this, of course, the meeting of neighboring countries was also on the agenda during the negotiations. I think it is possible to summarize the talks in this way.
 
 QUESTION: The family of the missing Iranian Askari went to our Embassy in Tehran and made some allegations. They said that Turkey handed over Askari to Israel with its own hands. I wonder what your assessment will be about these allegations, and has the family been given any explanation about Asgari?
 
 ANSWER: These allegations you mentioned have been in the international and Turkish press for a while. There is only one thing to be said about them: It is all speculation. It's all screenwriting. We do not pay attention to them. We have close contact and cooperation with Iran on this issue. Of course, it is quite normal for his family to come to our embassy and share his pain. We share whatever information we have with them.
 
 QUESTION: I have two questions, one about Iran. After or before the contacts with the British Foreign Secretary, how many times has the Minister met with his Iranian colleague since the military crisis broke out and what did he convey? Have you had any requests? You also said that the subject of the Istanbul meeting was discussed within the framework of the meetings with Hashemi. Like when? Do you expect it to be done in April?
 
 ANSWER: To be honest, the date of the meeting has not been finalized yet. As you know, Iraq has brought this up several times before. Iraq wishes to hold Neighboring Countries Meetings in Baghdad, if possible. But apart from Baghdad, it came to the agenda to be held in Istanbul in Cairo. As we understand from our last contacts, there is no hesitation about Istanbul. Just working on history. I mean it to answer your question. Probably in April.
 
 Regarding Iran, Minister Çavuşoğlu did not hold a private meeting with his Iranian counterpart directly addressing this issue. But as he stated yesterday, our Minister had a telephone conversation with his Iranian colleague in the evening, not yesterday, but the day before. In this meeting, besides Turkish-Iranian relations, current issues such as the Iraq Neighboring Countries Meeting were also discussed. Of course, at one stage of the meeting, as it was known that the British Foreign Minister had come to our country, this issue also came to the fore. After that, after the meetings between the British Foreign Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday, our Minister has not yet had contact with his Iranian colleague.
 
 QUESTION: You said that during the visit of the British Foreign Secretary, the issue of third countries' mediation came to the fore. Of course, you may not be aware of the Prime Minister's statement. But to clarify this mediation issue: Have we accepted the British Foreign Secretary's mediation proposal? Or does Iran welcome this mediation? Have we had any contact about it?
 
 ANSWER: In order to clarify the terminology we use, I would like to say that there is no such thing as mediation. Mediation has a very different meaning in international relations. What is mentioned here is an aid that came up during the negotiations. Turkey did not bring this issue to the agenda. What is this help, I cannot reach my citizens of England through my diplomatic representatives; I wonder if third countries can reach out on my behalf, he says. Of course, we said we would do our best to help. But to my knowledge, nothing has happened yet. Of course, as I said, the information in our Prime Minister is more up-to-date.
 
 QUESTION: We know that Europe, and even the United States, closely monitors the questions regarding the ignorance of the murder that took place after the murder of Hrant Dink, the Editor-in-Chief of Agos Newspaper. What kind of information do we give abroad about the developments regarding the murder? What kind of reactions are coming from them? There is also the opening of the Armenian church in Van. What preparations are there for this?
 
 ANSWER: There were some studies in the US Congress about our journalist who was the victim of an attack. I think it has been announced that these will be on the agenda tomorrow today. We do not know the exact content and final version of the submitted proposals. But our views on this matter are quite clear. We do not want parliaments to make such decisions. We believe that if there is a subject that concerns history, it should be examined directly by historians and a judgment should be made by historians. Not by parliamentarians. As far as I remember, the bill submitted to the Senate that you mentioned was on the agenda two or three weeks ago. As you know, for a long time, our government officials, diplomats, deputies, businessmen, and many groups representing the Turkish people in a wide range have been visiting the USA to explain our views to the Congress. In this context, I think we were able to convey our views to some people that a Senator recently delayed the approval of the bill, saying that some issues in this bill should be examined in more detail. Now, within the framework of the information we have provided, it is understood that a revised version of this bill has been presented. We do not know exactly what is in the bill, we will see it together. But this does not change our basic view on this issue. We do not know exactly what is in the bill, we will see it together. But this does not change our basic view on this issue. We do not know exactly what is in the bill, we will see it together. But this does not change our basic view on this issue.
 
 First of all, the point that should be emphasized about the opening of Akdamar Church is this: Preparations for the opening ceremony of Akdamar Church are carried out by the Van Governorship and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. They have the most up-to-date information. Because it was envisaged that after the invitations to abroad and domestically were made, the replies to the invitations would be sent directly to these authorities. But according to the information I have, a delegation headed by the Deputy Minister of Culture is coming from Armenia upon our invitation. Another official from Georgia is coming. In addition, many invitations were made to Armenian clergy and diaspora representatives. I know that Armenian clergy and diaspora representatives from many places such as Lebanon, America, Germany, Slovakia will attend. There will be people coming from France, Australia. Of course, figures from various other think tanks from Turkey and abroad who could influence public opinion were also invited to this ceremony. I know they will come too. As you know from our country, two ministers representing our government are expected to attend the ceremony.
 
 QUESTION: Regarding Akdamar, the Ministry of Culture asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for an opinion on whether or not the cross should be placed. What was the view of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: It seems that the Patriarch of the Armenians of Turkey made an attempt to our Ministry of Culture and Tourism in this regard. But this is not a ceremonial request. As far as we know, a general request, a general demand. If possible, they would like a cross to be affixed to the church here. Our Ministry of Culture and Tourism, related organizations and our Ministry also asked for their opinions on this issue. This just happened a couple of days ago. I would like to point this out. Our Ministry is working on this issue; Opinion formation work continues. As you know, the restoration of historical artifacts is a long-term business; requires a process. Naturally, it will be evaluated thoroughly and our opinion will be conveyed to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
 
 QUESTION: Tayyip Erdogan sent a condolence message to Kocharyan for the death of the Armenian Prime Minister. I don't know if it's technically possible, but; Did you get any reaction or a return from Armenia directly or indirectly?
 
 ANSWER: We have not received an answer to this at the moment. These types of messages, which are essentially prototypical, are always exchanged between countries. Upon the death of the Prime Minister of Armenia, our Prime Minister and Foreign Minister each sent a message of condolence to their opponents. But there is no established practice in the form of an answer to this. It may or may not come.
 
 QUESTION: There are reports that Special Counter-Terrorism Coordinators Ralston and Başer are meeting in America. Will there be participation in this meeting from Iraq or the Kurdistan region or Northern Iraq? Will they also take Iraqi officials to the meeting? Do you have any information about this?
 
 ANSWER: No, I don't know about this; but as you know, the coordinators keep in touch with each other frequently, including on the phone. Recently, the American coordinator was in Istanbul. Other than that, I don't have any other information.
 
 QUESTION: Angela Merkel's gift to Chiraq on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Rome agreement was talked about a lot in Turkey. Although yesterday, Mr. Gul made a statement about it. What I'm wondering is, did the Ministry of Foreign Affairs take any action on the German Ambassador or our Ambassador in Berlin?
 
 ANSWER: Our Minister gave the necessary answer to this. Apart from this, this issue is not a matter to be made a diplomatic initiative.
 
 QUESTION: It was stated that a decision could be taken at the COREPER meeting to be held on March 29, tomorrow, for the actual start of the negotiations on the chapter of enterprises and industrial policy. However, on Sunday, some statements came from the Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos that they could veto. I wonder if a definite date has come from the EU to Ankara regarding when this chapter can be opened, and how do you evaluate this statement?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, Intergovernmental Conferences on Accession between Turkey and the EU are held from time to time at the level of Chief Negotiator. According to the information I currently have, there is a possibility that the second meeting of this meeting will be held tomorrow. It's a pretty strong possibility. If it is done, it is expected that our Chief Negotiator, Minister of State Babacan will attend this meeting. At the meeting, the chapter of Enterprise and Industrial Policy will be opened for negotiation.
 
 There is not much to say about Papadopoulos' statement. As you know, Turkey has a strategy of trying to use the EU membership process for its own interests. This is part of the strategy. But I think that tomorrow's meeting will be held and another chapter will be announced.
 
 QUESTION: Did the delegation, which made investigations in Haremusherif, complete its report?
 
 ANSWER: We have mentioned this before in the statement we made on this subject. Our delegation, which went to Haremussherif, will turn their technical investigations into a report and present them directly to our Prime Minister. Therefore, after our Prime Minister receives this report, we will have to focus on this issue.
 
 Thank you very much for coming. I wish you good work, catch good and good news."

We made a short announcement yesterday, but I want to say it as a reminder. As you know, Turkey is a candidate for temporary membership of the United Nations Security Council. We continue to work on this issue internally and externally. Minister Çavuşoğlu will meet with the Turkish community today at noon within the framework of these efforts. A dinner will be held at the Sheraton Hotel and as we stated in our announcement, it will be possible to take a picture at the beginning of the meal.
 
 I have no official statement to make today. Therefore, if you allow, we can proceed directly to your questions.
 
 QUESTION: In the statement released after the National Security Council meeting held yesterday, it was stated that Turkey evaluated some approaches within the framework of the note given to Iraq. Could you give some information about this? What is Turkey's expectation regarding this note, and are any sanctions on Turkey's agenda, especially in the economic field?
 
 ANSWER: Naturally, it is not for me to interpret the details of the press release made by our National Security Council. Whatever points are mentioned there, you need to see it in that context. But I would like to point out a few things about the note. As you follow, Turkey recently delivered a security note to Iraq. The points in this note are very clear. Our expectation has also been very clear. We are currently awaiting a response. As you know, Turkey is a country that is friendly towards Iraq. Iraq is our neighbor. From the very beginning, Turkey has been a country that defends Iraq's territorial integrity and political unity. It is one of the countries that carry out studies in the international arena and even take initiatives in this regard. There should be no hesitation about this. But likewise, There should be no hesitation in Turkey's expectations from Iraq regarding security. Therefore, we request that the note we gave to Iraq be evaluated in this way. Our request is very clear.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, after your note, KDP leader Barzani insisted on similar statements and continued his discourse. What is your expectation from Barzani, the leader of the Kurdistan Regional Government? Does Turkey still keep its military operations on its agenda as well as political and economic sanctions, both in style and in the light of the MGK?
 
 ANSWER: I saw the news about Barzani's statements in the written and visual media today. that he had made the aforementioned statements regarding Turkey earlier, in February; then there are statements that there were threats from Turkey against Kirkuk. That should be emphasized. It does not matter when these statements are made. It is important that these statements are made. The points made in these statements are clear. Also, as I just mentioned, Turkey is a country that defends the territorial integrity and political unity of Iraq. It is not a country that threatens Iraq.
 
 QUESTION: The subject of military operation in Iraq?
 
 ANSWER: It would not be right for me to go into this matter. As I have just mentioned, Turkey asked Iraq to ensure border security, capture and extradite members of the terrorist organization PKK to Turkey, and assume Iraq's responsibilities within the framework of relevant UN resolutions; strongly requested. It awaits an answer.
 
 QUESTION: After Barzani's statements, did the KDP have any formal or informal contact with you? Did they provide an indirect explanation for Barzani's words?
 
 ANSWER: Our interlocutor is the Iraqi central government. We are in contact with them. It is not within my knowledge whether there is any other contact or not. I would like to point out one more thing within the framework of the question posed a moment ago. Something like what we expect from Barzani was said. We have expectations from Iraq, from the Iraqi central government.
 
 QUESTION: You said that a response is awaited from the Iraqi government. Is there a time limit for this response? Today, some media organs talk about a time like two weeks.
 
 ANSWER: There is talk of a period of two weeks in the press; but in our note, the Iraqi central government was asked to take decisive and urgent steps in this regard. Time is urgent.
 
 QUESTION: According to the results of this note, it is said that various sanctions may be applied to Iraq. Could it be possible to limit or close the Habur border gate among them?
 
 ANSWER: It would not be correct to talk about sanctions in this way and to go into details. There is nothing to say other than the elements put forward by our Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and naturally in the press release of the General Secretariat of the National Security Council yesterday and the day before.
 
 QUESTION: Some information came that the Iraq Neighboring Countries security meeting will be held in Sharm el Sheyh; but the Iranian administration said that the location is not clear yet. Is the Istanbul meeting postponed? Any progress on Istanbul?
 
 ANSWER: There can be no question of postponing the Istanbul meeting; because the date of the Istanbul meeting had not been determined anyway. What we care about here is that the Neighboring Countries Forum is active; Neighboring countries' meetings are held frequently, and as an extension of neighboring countries, the international community's views on Iraq are put forward in a forum. I have just stated what these views are and what we stand for. As you know, the Iraqi government has an explanation as to where the next stage of the meeting of the countries neighboring Iraq will be held. They announced that it is planned to be held in Sharm el Sheyh at the beginning of May. I have no information about the attitudes of other countries. I don't know if other countries will attend this meeting? . But to speak on behalf of Turkey, Turkey is already the father of ideas of the neighboring countries forum. As a neighbor of Iraq, he naturally attends this meeting in order to help Iraq. It doesn't matter where it's made. This is not the last meeting, after all. There will be other meetings after that. Our desire is for this process to continue.
 
 QUESTION: Is there a decision about the level of participation of Turkey in the meeting planned to be held in Egypt?
 
 ANSWER: No decision has been taken in this direction yet. Turkey is represented at the appropriate level. On the way to making this decision, both internal and external factors will naturally be taken into account.
 
 QUESTION: There were reports that Turkey's Special Representative for Iraq, Ambassador Celikkol, took some bribery documents about Barzani on his way to the United States. Are these news true?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information about what kind of documents our Special Representative has with him. But it should be noted that our Special Representative for Iraq brings up all the issues related to Iraq during his visits, both with the USA and with other countries.
 
 QUESTION: To return to the note crisis, now contacts with the USA have been established and the situation has been explained. Celikkol went to Washington. How does the USA view the situation? Could you please evaluate it for us?
 
 ANSWER: Let me first approach your question within the framework of our Special Representative's visit to Iraq. As you know, our Special Representative went there on the occasion of a conference organized by the German Marshall Fund and TOBB. But naturally, he had high-level contacts with the American administration. During these contacts, he naturally brought all the elements related to Iraq to the attention of our interlocutors. As for America's attitude, I think it is necessary to read and look at the latest statements made by the Spokesperson of the US Secretary of State.
 
 QUESTION: There was a news yesterday from Anadolu Agency. It is said that the Iraqis took 20 Turks prisoner on the grounds that a Turkish company in Iraq did not give their money. I think a message that someone passed to his wife has been reflected in the press. Do you have such information? Are there any Turkish prisoners in Iraq right now?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information about Turkish prisoners; However, as far as I know, there may be some of our citizens who are in a difficult situation there. Both our Mosul Consulate General and our Baghdad Embassy are interested in the issue. But at the moment, I do not have any information about the number of our citizens and their whereabouts.
 
 QUESTION: The Ministry's opinion was requested regarding the placing of a cross on the Akdamar Church. Has an opinion been formed on this?
 
 ANSWER: As far as I know, the opinion was created; The official response to our Ministry of Culture and Tourism was to be given these days. Let's explore it; Let us give you information about whether it is given to you or not.
 
 QUESTION: Has the report of the delegation that went to Haremussherif started to be prepared? If it has started to prepare, can I get information about what stage it is at?
 
 ANSWER: As far as we know, our delegation, which went to Haremusherif, is preparing a report with a very technical content in which all aspects of the subject are evaluated. It is envisaged that this report will be presented directly to our Prime Minister by our delegation. I think our delegation will complete its report in a few days and present it to our Prime Minister. It appears that this will be a long and technical report.
 
 If you have no further questions, I close our press conference with good wishes. Thanks for coming. I wish you good news and good news."

It is deemed necessary to remind the public opinion once again our points of view and expectations on these issues. 
 
 Amendment of the Iraqi constitution, and within this context amendment of Article 140 and postponement of the implementation of or determining the means of implementation of the said Article, are issues that should be resolved by the Iraqi National Assembly on a consensus basis. As these issues concern the common future of all Iraqis, settlement of such matters through consensus among all Iraqi groups is a necessity that commonsense and regional stability calls for. However, we witness with regret neither a common understanding nor a consensus emerging from the deliberations of the Iraqi National Assembly regarding this subject. 
 
 It is obvious that rushing these issues or attempting to solve them by one-sided approaches based on pushing near-sighted maximalist agendas of certain groups which entail fait accomplis will have negative repercussions on Iraq’s territorial integrity, national unity and internal peace. We expect that Turkey’s legitimate concerns be taken into consideration. Turkey has always given high priority to the well-being of Iraq. 
 
 In fact, numerous recently published reports, including International Crisis Group’s Kirkuk Report and Baker-Hamilton Report, prove that our country’s concerns on regional stability are widely shared by the international community. In this respect, we preserve our conviction that all challenges that concern Iraq should be resolved through consensus-based solutions, involving active participation of all Iraqi groups. 
 
 Furthermore, decisions on the implementation of Article 140 must not be based on fait accomplis or coercion. Rather, as with all other challenges in Iraq, this issue should be resolved through the common will of all the groups represented at the Iraqi National Assembly taking into consideration the common future and interests of all the components of the Iraqi nation. 
 
 Disruptive situations emanating from Iraq affect not only Iraq and Iraqi citizens, but also its neighbours and our region. As such, Turkey’s sensitivities stem from the importance it attaches to regional security and stability, and they should by no means be interpreted as interference in Iraq’s domestic affairs."

Thank you for coming to the meeting. As you know, we were holding our press conferences on Wednesdays. However, we thought it more appropriate to do it on Thursday this week. I'll take your questions shortly. But first, I would like to make a reminder. The opening of Batumi International Airport, which has been modernized with Turkish partnership, will be held this weekend and our Minister will travel to Batumi to attend this opening ceremony. It was announced.
 
 In addition, consultation meetings will be held at our Ministry today and tomorrow, under the chairmanship of our Minister, with the participation of our Honorable Ambassadors working in this region, in order to evaluate the developments in the Gulf region. Our Ambassadors coming to Ankara will also make some contacts. As you know, very dynamic developments are taking place in the Middle East. These are on the agenda of both the countries of the region and the international community. From a geostrategic point of view, developments in the Middle East and the Gulf region are of great interest to us. We have to watch them closely. Based on this approach, evaluation meetings will be held in our Ministry today and tomorrow with the participation of our Honorable Ambassadors, who work in the Gulf countries, in order to discuss the reflections of the developments in the Middle East on the Gulf and to exchange views on these issues. Our Minister will chair these meetings. It can be said that the meetings have two main purposes. The first is to consider the reflections of the activity in the Middle East on the Gulf, which is in its immediate vicinity, and to evaluate its effects. The second is to address the current course of our bilateral relations with the countries of the region. In this direction, it is the review of all dimensions of our relations with the countries of the region. Such evaluation meetings are held from time to time. As you know, such an evaluation meeting was held last January under the chairmanship of our Minister, with the participation of our Ambassadors working in the Middle East region. Such meetings form the basis for the revision of both our foreign policy expectations and targets, and they have beneficial results for the future.
 
 These are the two things I can share with you today. Now we can move on to your questions.
 
 …………
 
 QUESTION: Could the two-day important meeting with the ambassadors from the Gulf countries have anything to do with the Chief of General Staff's sign that the source of terrorism, especially after the bomb attack in Ulus, might be abroad? I mean, regarding the Middle East and Gulf regions?
 
 ANSWER: No, there is not. Preparations for such meetings are made and planned long in advance. These, too, have been planned in advance and, as I have just mentioned, they are being carried out to address the reflections of the developments in the Middle East on the Gulf, and also to evaluate our bilateral relations with the Gulf countries.
 
 QUESTION: On April 9, a note about the PKK was given to Iraq. It's been quite a long time. My question is: Was there any actual or verbal response to this note? Secondly, can Turkey legally carry out an operation against Northern Iraq in any way from the Turkish Grand National Assembly? Third, is there any preparation for a bill in your Ministry?
 
 ANSWER: I need to look at the answer to your first question, as you stated, it has been a while. I currently do not have any information. Secondly, when we look at the region from the point of view of administrative and technical preparations on whether Turkey should carry out an operation and how it can be done, I think it is necessary to take the statements made by our Prime Minister and Minister recently as a basis. I have nothing to add to the issues that our esteemed Prime Minister said yesterday.
 
 QUESTION: There are some reports in the media that the Special Representative of Iraq, Ambassador Oğuz Çelikkol, will go to Iraq at the weekend. Could you give some information about this visit? Who are you scheduled to meet and what is expected?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, our Special Representative for Iraq, Ambassador Celikkol, travels not only to Iraq but also to other countries from time to time. Within this framework, a certain travel program is followed. A visit to Iraq in the coming days is more or less certain. I can't share the dates with you yet. Naturally, when he goes to Iraq in his capacity as the Special Envoy for Iraq, he will, as always, hold talks with various circles, senior government officials and below at the technical level. Apart from that, the visit of our Special Representative to Iraq has nothing to do with the latest developments. But naturally, when he gets there, he will deal with everything.
 
 QUESTION: Will Mr. Celikkol and his team have a meeting with the American troops serving in Iraq during their contacts in Iraq? Will he have contact with military officials?
 
 ANSWER: I do not have any information about the details of the program at the moment.
 
 QUESTION : You said you don't know about the details of the program, but Ambassador Celikkol had a meeting with KDP leader Mesud Barzani when he traveled to Iraq before. Will there be such a meeting on this trip?
 
 ANSWER: As I said, unfortunately, I cannot share the details of the program with you at the moment. But let me say this. It is envisaged that Mr. Çelikkol will make various contacts at both the senior and technical level. I say it is foreseen because, as I have just mentioned, work continues on both the dates and the details of the program. It wouldn't be right for me to share some things that are not finalized.
 
 QUESTION: After the note on April 9, you said at the press conference on April 11, ""We are waiting for an urgent and decisive step"". More than a month has passed since then. Is this expectation of urgency not fulfilled? Could you comment on this?
 
 ANSWER: The point stated in our note is clear. We have emphasized this several times before. We do not necessarily expect a written response to the note. What we expect is urgent and decisive action. We will probably have the opportunity to discuss these issues in more detail with you in the coming days.
 
 QUESTION: Did Ambassador Rafet Akgünay, Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have any meetings with the American coordinator Ralston after he was appointed as Turkey's Special Representative for the Fight Against Terrorism? Is there a date, a time unit planned for a new round of face-to-face talks with the United States on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, the appointment of Ambassador Rafet Akgünay, one of our Deputy Undersecretaries, was made a day or two ago, on May 21. He has not had any contact with the American coordinator so far. No further details have been determined for the upcoming meetings.
 
 QUESTION: In the news from Brussels, these are the news that have been confirmed by both European Union diplomats and NATO officials, it is said that Turkey has taken a stance preventing closer cooperation between NATO and the European Union. It is said that he put forward some reservations about Southern Cyprus as the reason for this. Can you make a statement on this subject?
 
 ANSWER: First of all, let me state this. Turkey's views on the Greek Cypriot Administration are known by everyone. We have repeatedly said that the Greek Cypriot Administration does not represent the whole of the island, does not represent the Turkish Cypriot side, and cannot and will not; we recorded it. Turkey has no objections to the development of relations between NATO and the EU. As a matter of fact, Turkey takes part in the international operations carried out within the framework of this cooperation mechanism. The point that Turkey is sensitive about is that this bilateral cooperation should be carried out in accordance with the pre-determined, that is, the still existing reconciliation between the two organizations, within the framework of the reconciliation accepted by all the allies, the EU and NATO. Apart from this, Turkey does not have any expectations.
 
 QUESTION: In parallel with this question, I will ask the following. It is said that Turkey somehow hinders the EU and NATO cooperation in Kosovo because of the Greek Cypriot Administration, and is against the establishment of a security unit there. I wonder if Turkey will lift this reservation, its veto on anything concrete regarding Kosovo?
 
 ANSWER: First of all, there is no veto. Because Turkey already takes place in NATO's KFOR force serving in Kosovo. We contribute there with an association of 400 people. We will take over KFOR's southern regional command on May 29, and this number will increase to 700. Turkey supports the European Security and Defense Policy, in other words, this policy, which we briefly refer to as ESDP. In this context, we are confident that the police mission to be carried out will contribute to security and stability in Kosovo; we have no doubt about it. Naturally, while the EU mission is on duty in Kosovo, it will perform its duty by taking advantage of the security environment created by NATO in Kosovo. Therefore, the answer I gave to the previous question can be considered valid for this as well. Turkey does not object in any way to the cooperation between NATO and the EU specifically in Kosovo; does not oppose. We only ask that care be taken to stay within the framework that the two organizations have previously agreed upon. That is all we expect.
 
 QUESTION: Yesterday, French President Sarkozy made some statements about Turkey. There was an expectation in Ankara that his anti-Turkey rhetoric would soften after he took office. But on the contrary, he still says that he is against Turkey's EU membership and that his opinion will not change. Can we get an assessment on this?
 
 ANSWER: It is useful to remind some points. First of all, Turkey's relations with the EU were not developed yesterday. This goes back a very long time. Turkey has been a member of the Customs Union for a long time. Turkey is a country that has been registered as meeting the Copenhagen criteria adequately by all EU countries, including France, and has started negotiations. Currently, Turkey is negotiating with the EU. Therefore, it is necessary to look at it like this: Turkey's target towards the EU is clear. Turkey's status in the EU is clear. Turkey is a negotiating country and the goal of Turkey's negotiations was ultimately determined as full membership. Other than that, there is nothing else. But of course, from time to time, some EU member state officials or EU institutions make statements that will have negative repercussions on Turkey's EU negotiation process. We do not see these as encouraging statements for Turkey. Naturally, it would be better not to do this.
 
 QUESTION: Turkey was shaken by a big explosion two days ago. He faced terrorism once again. After this, some reactions came to Turkey. Reactions that were supportive, or at least condemning terrorism, poured in. As Turkey, do you have any calls to our allies for terrorism at this stage? Especially NATO member countries. Secondly, you said that Turkey's EU target is clear, but as far as I know, Turkey's Association Council meeting in June has been postponed once again. It is stated that this was postponed at the request of Turkey. Why is that? How many more negotiation chapters do you expect to be opened in June? Also, are you still hopeful about the Direct Trade Regulation? Because there was no result from COREPER.
 
 ANSWER: Let me start with the last question. The Direct Trade Regulation is an EU commitment to Turkish Cypriots; It's a promise he made. We have repeatedly said that this promise must be kept. A very large group of countries within the EU are already suffering from this. We think it will be beneficial to do this as soon as possible.
 
 International terrorism is a phenomenon that has been harshly condemned by Turkey for years. Turkey is a country that has always called for international cooperation on international terrorism. I think you have followed closely. After the last incident, Turkey has once again made a call to the international community through the mouth of our Prime Minister. Our Honorable Prime Minister emphasized the need to establish a platform for cooperation in the international arena. Naturally, Turkey maintains this view and deals with this issue in individual contacts with all its interlocutors.
 
 From the point of view of negotiation with the EU, perhaps the following summary can be made: As I have just mentioned, Turkey is a country that continues its negotiations. As you know, negotiations were opened and closed on a chapter. Negotiations were also started on the chapter on Enterprise and Industrial Policies. But it cannot be closed within the framework of a decision taken by the EU. In the past period, we submitted our Negotiation Position Documents in three more chapters and we are currently waiting for the EU side to submit its own position documents. These are the statistics chapter, the economic and monetary policies chapter and the financial control chapter. Our expectation is that the EU will submit the counter-position document and that these three chapters will be opened to negotiations under normal conditions in the next June without any problems.
 
 As for the Association Council, as you know, the Association Committee, which made the preparations for this Council, met last March. It was concluded that it would be more appropriate to hold the ministerial meeting of the Association Council during the next term presidency due to some considerations both on the EU side and on Turkey's side. This is a mutual evaluation. It does not point to anything else.
 
 QUESTION: What considerations?
 
 ANSWER: These are technical things. We had it both on the EU side and on us. It was concluded that it would be more appropriate to hold the meeting under the next term presidency in order to make better preparations and train them.
 
 QUESTION: In a statement he gave to a defense magazine a short time ago, the Chief of the General Staff said that unfortunately, many of the countries that provide the PKK with the opportunity to operate in some way are NATO member countries. After the last incident in Ankara, has Turkey made a new attempt at NATO? On condemning terrorism or taking a more effective method against it. Secondly, a friend of ours just asked: Has the preparation of a motion started in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regardless of what the Prime Minister said or in connection with him?
 
 ANSWER: Let me start with your last question. I do not have any information about the preparation of the motion.
 
 As for terrorism. I did not see the statement of our Chief of General Staff that you refer to. But we know that in some European countries there are some subsidiaries supporting the PKK terrorist organization, some media organs, some non-governmental organizations or some formations operating under the heading of cultural bureaus. This, of course, alone does not directly indicate whether these countries have support. But we are always persistently trying to put an end to the activities of these formations before these countries.
 
 QUESTION: In your answer to the question about the deployment of the EU Police Force in Kosovo, you used the phrase that it was carried out within the framework of past agreements. What are the past conventions you're noticing here? What is Ankara's expectation within the framework of these agreements? Can we get a little more concrete assessment here?
 
 ANSWER: The details may be technical. Let me just answer it this way: What we understand from this agreed framework are the decisions taken by the EU at the Copenhagen Summit in December 2002 and the subsequent decisions of the NATO Council. There are decisions that everyone agrees on, and we want the cooperation to stay within this framework.
 
 QUESTION: Roj TV is mentioned in the same article of the Chief of General Staff. It is mentioned that the terrorist organization sometimes takes its orders directly from here. What was the process regarding the closure of Roj TV? We also know that Turkish F-16s were harassed by Greek F-16s while they were making training flights during the Sea Wolf Exercise in Izmir. There are reports that the General Staff made some requests to warn you about Greece, but they were not met. What are your assessments on this matter?
 
 ANSWER: I am not aware of these claims. These are just speculation. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately takes the necessary steps after such events in the Aegean. It continues to do so. As you already know, Turkey is very sensitive about this issue.
 
 We had long attempts to shut down Roj TV. As far as I know, these have also been brought to court. The judiciary made some decisions in Denmark. However, we do not share them; We think that Roj TV should be shut down. We presented evidence of this. We continue to present. We will insist on this.
 
 QUESTION: In his assessment yesterday, Sarkozy said that Turkey should not be discussed at the EU Summit to be held in June, that this should be left for later, and that the EU should first focus on decisions regarding its own internal functioning. I wonder how realistic is your expectation of opening a topic in June within the framework of this statement?
 
 ANSWER: The President you refer to represents a single EU member. The EU is made up of many countries. Maybe it would be right for me to say: Our expectation is a realistic expectation. Because we are of the opinion that the Negotiation Position Documents submitted by Turkey in these three chapters are in line with the European Union acquis. In this context, we believe that the EU will approach our negotiation position documents in a very objective way and that negotiations will be opened in three chapters under normal conditions in June.

Welcome to our weekly press conference. There is no statement that I will share with you today. So we can go directly to your questions. Let's take the first question.
 
 
 …………
 
 
 QUESTION: Although you made a statement yesterday regarding the violation of the airspace of two US F-16 aircraft, you said that you were informed by the General Staff on the same day. There is first-in-come and later-input information, so what's the mess here? So there was a coordination problem? At least within the State Department itself? Secondly, why was it necessary to call a lower-level representative instead of the Ambassador while the Note was being given?
 
 ANSWER: The statements we have made on this matter and the elements in the written response we gave to a question of a member of the press yesterday are still valid. There is no uncoordination. To repeat, when such a violation occurs, communications and notifications are made between our General Staff and our Ministry within the framework of established procedures. As I have provided for your information in my answer to the question yesterday, the General Staff gave us the usual notification on the day of the violation. Upon our request, detailed and additional technical information that will form the basis for the necessary initiative, namely the necessary initiative in the relevant country, reached us on Monday, and as you know, this attempt was made on Tuesday. During the initiative, a Note on the subject was deposited in the USA. The arbitrariness was explained and it was demanded that necessary measures be taken to prevent such violations. It is not very remarkable at what level the attempt is made. The important thing is the initiative made before the relevant country, the statements used in the initiative and the Note given. Therefore, there is nothing else I can add on this subject.
 
 QUESTION: Is there a special reason why the technical report requested from the Chief of General Staff is requested on Monday instead of on Thursday or the following Friday, that is, it has to be waited until Monday for the necessary action to be taken?
 
 ANSWER: No, as I just said, technical knowledge is needed in order to take necessary action in such violations within the framework of established procedures. Sometimes this information may not be enough. Our Chief of General Staff informed us of the violation that day. Afterwards, the necessary information reached our Ministry on Monday. Necessary steps have been taken. Beyond that, there's nothing more to say about it anymore.
 
 QUESTION: The USA decided to withdraw from Northern Iraq at a time when it was discussing an operation in Northern Iraq. However, the inclusion of Peshmerga and Kurdish Peshmerga in the central authority was discussed. Now the USA left Northern Iraq to the Kurds. He left it to the Kurdish Peshmerga. The US Ambassador, Mr. Wilson, was asked about this yesterday. He said very clearly, ""Your interlocutor from now on is the Kurds."" If we look from the Ankara front, how are we going to read this decision to withdraw and leave it to the Peshmerga? How does this make any sense?
 
 
 ANSWER: Statements were made yesterday by the relevant US authorities on this issue. As you said, the US Ambassador has various statements. The Spokesperson of the US State Department also has statements on this subject. When you read them all carefully, you will see that the transfer of security by the USA to the Iraqi government authorities, to the Iraqi authorities is not a new element. As the spokesman said, within the framework of a plan that has been worked on for 3-4 years, the US will directly transfer the security in certain regions of Iraq to the forces under the control of the Iraqi central government, when the conditions it deems necessary, within the framework of a certain program, in order to share the responsibility in security and to ensure that the Iraqi government does its part. is transferring. As far as I know, this has been done in 7 of the 18 regions, in the south of Iraq and various other parts. I think, according to their own planning, now it's time for the north. In this context, you also referred to the statements of the US Ambassador in your statements. As far as I can see, the US Ambassador states that this was done in a planned manner and says that security has been handed over to the Iraqi central authorities. For us, the transfer of security is the transfer of the Iraqi central authority to the elements.
 
 QUESTION: I have two questions. The first is about this Note. As you said, with Nota we asked the US not to repeat such violations. If it happens again, what measures can be taken? Can you give me information about this? My second question is about the withdrawal of American forces. Could you give us some information about the power in Northern Iraq? I mean, does Iraq really have a regular army there? Or are the Peshmerga forces under control there, and this is really in the Iraqi army, not the Peshmerga? Did the Americans somehow confirm this?
 
 ANSWER: There has been no discussion between us and the Americans on this issue at the moment. However, as a result of various contacts we have carried out in the past, we can say that the USA is carrying out a work for the Iraqi central government to ensure security throughout the country. What is important for us is not giving the responsibility to ethnic groups or local forces, but to transfer it directly to the Iraqi central government. It seems that this is what is done today. Regarding the note, I think you are asking what would happen if it was repeated one more time. This question was asked to our Prime Minister yesterday. I will direct you there. Our Prime Minister has a very clear statement on this issue.
 
 QUESTION: Was it communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that when the General Staff reported the F-16 violation on Thursday, it would be shared with the public? Did the State Department know about this?
 
 ANSWER: There is no such thing.
 
 QUESTION: Apart from giving a Note with the US officials regarding the F-16s, was there any discussion with the American officials about how the incident happened? As far as we know, F-16s are extremely high-tech planes, and it doesn't seem very possible with this technology that they don't notice this border, at least not two planes at the same time. How do they explain this, how could it have been a mistake, are the indicators not working, or the pilots did not realize that they had crossed the border?
 
 ANSWER: During the meeting, in which the note was given to the US side, they were naturally asked for an explanation. The US side also expressed its views openly to the press. They repeated this. So, in summary, they said: Yes, it is true that it is a violation. This violation was caused by pilot error. We obtained this result from our initial research. They said that we will take the necessary measures to prevent such violations from being repeated as soon as possible. I would also like to remind you. In the statement of the US Spokesperson on this issue, it was emphasized that the US respects Turkish airspace very much.
 
 QUESTION: Ambassador Oğuz Çelikkol and a group of diplomats were in Iraq and held contacts. This visit was planned after the response to Turkey's Nota. Now, what kind of road do you have in front of you in Turkey-Iraq relations from now on? What kind of steps do you expect Iraq to take within the framework of the response given after the Nota? Did Ambassador Rafet Akgünay talk to his counterpart?
 
 ANSWER: Let me start with your last question, as of now, according to my knowledge, Ambassador Akgünay has not had any meeting with his American counterpart. Returning to your first question, I think our Special Representative for Iraq gave information to a news agency about this yesterday. There you can find answers to many of the questions you are thinking of asking today. But let me tell you in order to answer your question. As you know, the last visit of our Special Representative to Iraq was a pre-planned visit. There were news that linked the visit with the recent developments in Turkey. I repeat once again that this is not true. Although it was a very short visit, our Special Representative for Iraq was really well received. Some appointments could be arranged in a very short time. With the two Vice Presidents, the Prime Minister, He had extensive meetings with the two Deputy Prime Ministers, the Speaker of the Parliament, the US Ambassador to Iraq, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and his deputy. During these meetings, our Iraqi Special Representative provided additional information to all Iraqi interlocutors with whom he met, not only about the economic, commercial and cultural relations between Turkey and Iraq, but also about the activities of terrorist organization PKK elements in Northern Iraq, naturally, following our Note. He explained this himself. Our expectations from Iraq are very clear. It is cooperation with us to stop all terrorist activities from Northern Iraq to Turkey, terrorist activities in every sense. It's about taking steps. The impression of our Special Representative in Iraq from the last contacts,
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, you informed us about what Ambassador Çelikkol might have said during these meetings. Again, there are some statements in Ambassador Celikkol's interview. That's how it got a positive impression from Iraq. However, we still need some clarification in terms of content. Rather than the impressions of Mr. Ambassador Celikkol, is there really an answer you can give us about whether these talks were satisfactory for Ankara or not? Or would Mr. Ambassador Celikkol consider informing us?
 
 ANSWER: I would like Ambassador Çelikkol to inform you about it. If possible, we will naturally do so. However, I would like to remind you that. Turkey is indeed fighting a great deal of terrorism. It is fighting terrorism with an international dimension. The fight against terrorism is an issue that requires patience and very careful steps. You know these too well. Therefore, now, in the last visit, if our Honorable Special Representative for Iraq says that there are some positive impressions in his statements, that this can be followed with some steps, and he is content with that, it would be more beneficial to leave this issue. Because, as you know, the fight against terrorism is sensitive.
 
 QUESTION: Is it normal that Ambassador Rafet Akgünay has not had a meeting with his counterpart yet? We had an explosion in the nation. It was certain that it was a terrorist attack. How should we interpret the fact that they still haven't met, even if it's for a greeting? My second question is, does Turkey issue a diplomatic note after every air violation, no matter what country it is? Or are other methods used from time to time depending on the violation, is it possible to apply another method? Can a verbal warning be given? How does this happen, can you explain a little bit about it?
 
 ANSWER: Thank you for asking this question. Because, as you said, sometimes these issues can be confused. When such violations occur, it is necessary to look at the nature of the violation. Where did it come from, which country did it come from, was it intentional, was it an error or did it have another purpose? Technically speaking, what altitude was he flying from? How long did he stay in Turkey? Has he been warned? Did he respond to the warning or not? Was this a repeated violation? Did the same country do this all the time or not, or did something happen once in 10 years? By taking all these factors into account, the level and strength of the necessary initiative is naturally determined. In other words, it is possible to protest or take other steps in a way that will disrupt the relations between the two countries and make the situation worse. These can be done but as I said, all these things depend on the nature of the event and technical knowledge. Sometimes there are situations where you can see a violation. However, upon closer examination, it may turn out that this is not a violation. Such things have happened in the past. Therefore, it is necessary to be very meticulous, give great importance to technical issues and make an evaluation after receiving them. It can be verbal or written. I honestly don't have much to say about Ambassador Rafet Akgünay's meeting with his American counterpart. I can say that there has been no meeting so far. It is necessary to attach great importance to technical issues and an evaluation should be made after receiving them. It can be verbal or written. I honestly don't have much to say about Ambassador Rafet Akgünay's meeting with his American counterpart. I can say that there has been no meeting so far. It is necessary to attach great importance to technical issues and an evaluation should be made after receiving them. It can be verbal or written. I honestly don't have much to say about Ambassador Rafet Akgünay's meeting with his American counterpart. I can say that there has been no meeting so far.
 
 QUESTION: As you just mentioned, Ambassador Oguz Celikkol made several contacts in Iraq. As you know, a cross-border operation is on Turkey's agenda right now. Was it told to the Iraqi side during the contacts of Ambassador Oğuz Çelikkol, “In case PKK terror continues, the cross-border operation is on our table, you know too”?
 
 ANSWER: It would not be right to elaborate the content of these talks to this extent. I would just like to remind you of a statement made by our Honorable Minister before. The country that will decide whether to organize a cross-border operation is Turkey. He doesn't have to share it with anyone else.
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, can we understand the following from your explanations regarding the technical procedure of the F-16 violations? Have you been convinced by the Americans' defense that it was an accident and no intent? Secondly, was there any attempt at NATO, such as a complaint or a notification to NATO? Or is it thought to be found?
 
 ANSWER: You are aware that there is a lot of talk about the violation of Turkish airspace by two US planes. I would like to reiterate one last time. Two aircraft belonging to the USA violated our airspace. The United States acknowledged this violation. He told us that he would do the right thing. The Republic of Turkey also demanded that such violations should not happen again, by issuing a Note to the USA. Beyond that, there is nothing more to say anymore.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, was there any border violation by the USA, albeit on a smaller scale, on Turkey's Iraq border?
 
 ANSWER: I don't know, we need to investigate. As far as I can remember there is no such thing in recent history, but we can investigate it for you if you wish.
 
 QUESTION: Since yesterday, there have been reports that US-origin rocket launchers were found on a train said to have deviated from its path as a result of an attack organized by the PKK in the Genç district of Bingöl. Apart from that, these weapons are said to be loaded from Iran and heading towards Syria. In addition, another plane is being searched for a forced landing in Diyarbakir, and no weapons are found. But after all these two developments, was there any contact with the Iranian and Syrian authorities? What is the progress?
 
 ANSWER: First, I saw the news that there was a rocket on a train, that they were of American origin, and that the PKK attacked the train. However, at the same time, as far as I can see, our relevant authorities have started a comprehensive investigation on this issue. The Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor is also active. Therefore, it would not be right to comment on such an incident without obtaining the results of the investigation. Secondly, in today's news, it is stated that a plane making the Damascus-Tehran flight was landed and searched while it was in Turkish airspace. You know, this has happened in the past. Last year, I think 10-12 planes were searched in this way. This is a right under the sovereign authority of every country. If deemed necessary, the aircraft is invited to land. That's how it was done. He was invited to check in and the plane complied. He was looked after and then allowed to move on. Beyond that, there is nothing else.
 
 QUESTION: The important thing for Turkey is the transfer of security to the Iraqi central government. It is not handed over to local powers. However, he constantly stated that he sees the Peshmerga forces as a military force belonging to him in the Northern Iraqi Administration. Does Turkey accept the Peshmerga forces as subordinate to the Iraqi central government? If we start from the fact that he didn't, can you give an answer to this question again? How do you evaluate this should not be left to the Peshmerga power?
 
 ANSWER: Now look, Turkey is closely watching everything that is happening in Iraq, you know this, and there are a few issues that we care about here. We have repeated before. We attach importance to the territorial integrity of Iraq, we attach importance to its political unity, and that there are no divisions on the basis of sects, religion or ethnicity in Iraq, as a country that has preserved the political unity of Iraq as a whole and under a central government and control. We desire an Iraq provided by the central government, at every point, every minute, everywhere. This is our view of the plans implemented by the USA, which can be said to be the transfer of responsibility that you refer to. If indeed the Iraqi central government, as we know it, If the USA delegates some responsibilities to a power controlled by the central government with which we do business, there is nothing more to say about it. Of course we're watching this. The latest information we have received is that this assignment will start tomorrow. We will follow this closely.
 
 QUESTION: You know, Switzerland had a law that criminalized the denial of the So-called Armenian Genocide, and there are some news that this law will change. Doğu Perinçek has statements in this direction. Do you have any information coming in this direction? Was information requested from Switzerland? And if it is changed how do you look at it?
 
 ANSWER: A Swiss government official is working on changing an existing law that is really causing our displeasure. If this is true, and if there is a new study that will remove the barriers to freedom of expression, as befits a truly democratic country, we will only be pleased with it. But of course, we have to see the result of this. We are watching.
 
 QUESTION: David Lavitte, adviser to French President Sarkozy, held talks in Ankara. What was discussed in these contacts, I will be glad if you give some information. Also, the Troika Meeting will be held in Ankara on Monday. What are Turkey's expectations in this regard, what are their primary expectations?
 
 ANSWER: Let me start with your last question. Another one of the usual Troika meetings will be held between the EU and Turkey on Monday. It is envisaged that our Minister will also attend this meeting. As you know, in the Troika meetings, the point of relations between the EU and Turkey, the negotiating country, is reviewed. The possibilities of where this point can be moved are explored, and at the same time, international and regional problems that concern both sides are also addressed in a part of the Troika meetings. Again, this is a regular meeting that will take place within this framework. You know our expectations from the EU, Turkey is a country where negotiations have started. Our expectation from the EU in the three new chapters that we have presented the negotiation position documents is to present its position document in these chapters as soon as possible. In this context,
 
 The President of France, Mr. Sarkozy, made new appointments after he took office. One of them appointed Mr. Lavitte as his foreign policy adviser. Ambassador Lavitte is a career diplomat, an experienced diplomat who has served in diplomacy for a long time. Our Prime Minister also mentioned it in a television interview yesterday. Following the meeting of our Prime Minister with President Sarkozy, the desire to work more closely on issues concerning the relations between the two countries was expressed. Ambassador Lavitte's wish to come to Turkey was accepted and he came to our country and met with the foreign policy advisor of our Prime Minister and our Undersecretary at our Ministry. These meetings were both an introductory visit. Because after all, we are talking about a newly appointed official. Of course, it also provided some opportunity to review the relations between the two countries. Beyond that, I am not in a position to share the content of the conversation with you.
 
 QUESTION: There is a lot of news in the press today about the plan that France specifically calls Club Med. Some EU members will also take part. In fact, the information that 17 of the Mediterranean countries will be invited has now been reflected in the press. Was the Club Med proposal brought up by the French leader discussed during this visit? If Turkey encounters such an invitation, does it intend to accept it? Or did he indicate from the beginning that he would not participate?
 
 ANSWER: Turkey's assessment on this issue is still ongoing. Why is it running? Because there is nothing concrete about what the ideas in France's mind encompass, how broad they are, and when they can be put forward. But naturally, Turkey makes its own assessment. But it is worth emphasizing this. Within the framework of Turkey's EU relations, if it refers to this proposal, the parameters of Turkey's relations with the EU are quite clear. Turkey is a country whose negotiations have been opened with the agreement of all EU countries and which continues negotiations and aims for full membership.
 
 QUESTION: At the EU summit held in December 2006, after the verbal Cyprus proposals of Finland and Turkey, a promise was made to Turkey and it was said that as the German Presidency started, steps will be taken regarding Cyprus, especially on the Direct Trade Regulation. However, as you know, there is 1 month and 1 day left until the end of the German Presidency. However, there is still no progress. Does Turkey expect a new breakthrough regarding Cyprus from the German Presidency? Or if a step will not come from Germany, will he take a step himself?
 
 ANSWER: Thank you. There was an understanding within the framework of what you said about Cyprus, it is true. Even the EU has taken a decision on this issue. He revealed that the issue of providing these opportunities to the Turkish Cypriot side for direct trade should be finalized during the German Presidency. But as of now, there has been no change in the result of our contacts with Germany or the contacts of TRNC officials. Therefore, I do not see a development that would require us to be optimistic about this issue. The reasons for this are also clear. The Greek Cypriot Administration, which spent all its efforts to become an EU member and misled the EU countries, now benefits from the veto right provided by the EU mechanisms, after becoming an EU member. This is naturally not a desirable approach.
 
 QUESTION: How will the transfer of security in Northern Iraq to the Peshmerga affect Turkey's fight against terrorism and will it create a problem in case of a possible cross-border operation? Or will it be beneficial or harmful for Turkey?
 
 ANSWER: These are all being evaluated.
 
 Thank you sir, keep up the good news."
2007-06-06,6/6/2007,"06 Haziran 2007, Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Levent Bilman´ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı","06 June 2007, Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Levent Bilman",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/06-haziran-2007_-disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-levent-bilman_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi-.tr.mfa,,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,PKK,0,0,"BİLMAN: Dear friends, welcome to our weekly press briefing.
 
 First of all, I would like to make some clarifications on some issues.
 
 A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Republic of Turkey and the European Community on the participation of the Republic of Turkey in the 7th Framework Program for the European Community's research, technology and development activities. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed in Brussels on 1 June by our Permanent Representative to the EU, Ambassador Volkan Bozkır, and the European Commission's Director-General for Research, Jose Manuel Silva Rodriguez. With the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding, our country officially joins the 7th Framework Programme, which is one of the most important programs of the EU with a budget of 53.2 billion Euros, covering the 2007-2013 period, following the 6th Framework Program covering the 2002-2006 period.
 
 You will remember that our country participated in the 6th Framework Program before and this participation played an important role in the temporary closure of the Science and Research chapter on 12 June 2006, which was discussed in the negotiations. EU community programs are among the tools that provide close acquaintance with EU policies and their working principles and constitute an important element of the pre-accession strategy. Our Ministry made intense contacts with the European Commission during the process of taking the decision of our country to participate in the program. He also contributed to the preparation of both the Memorandum of Understanding and the related Action Plan.
 
 While talking about this Action Plan, I would like to state the following: A special Action Plan for our country was prepared with the EU Commission in order to increase the visibility and success rate of our country in these programs and to ensure its effectiveness in thematic programs. This plan covers the period 2007-2008 in the first phase. The 7th Framework Program will be carried out under the coordination of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey. We are sending you our more comprehensive official statement on this subject as a full text in the usual ways.
 
 As for the second issue that I will share with you today, at the last press conference, I made a statement emphasizing the importance we attach to consultations with our Ambassadors in the administration of Turkish Foreign Policy. In this context, I reminded the consultation meetings held in Ankara with our Ambassadors in the Middle East region last January, and I said that similar meetings will be held in Ankara with our Ambassadors in the Gulf region on May 24-25. This time, consultation meetings will be held at our Ministry on 7 June 2007 with the participation of our Ambassadors serving in the Balkan countries. Our Esteemed Ambassadors, who came to Turkey for this purpose, will also be received by our Esteemed President. In the consultations, it will be focused on what steps can be taken in the context of developing and deepening the relations of our country with the Balkan countries in general. Naturally, regional problems, developments in Kosovo and increasing our commercial relations and cultural contacts with Balkan countries will be discussed. In addition, it is envisaged to discuss the general political, economic and social situation of our fellow countrymen in the Balkan countries with our Ambassadors. As you know, Turkey attaches special importance to the development of its relations with the Balkan countries in every field. We believe that these consultations will make important contributions to the shaping and implementation of our policies towards the Balkans in the coming period. The developments in Kosovo and increasing our commercial relations and cultural contacts with the Balkan countries will be discussed. In addition, it is envisaged to discuss the general political, economic and social situation of our fellow countrymen in the Balkan countries with our Ambassadors.

Turkey attaches special importance to the development of its relations with the Balkan countries in every field. We believe that these consultations will make important contributions to the shaping and implementation of our policies towards the Balkans in the coming period.
 
 Finally, the development I would like to bring to your attention is a new step taken in our relations with the USA. On February 8-9, the third meeting of the Economic Partnership Commission between Turkey and the USA was held in Istanbul and Ankara. These meetings, you will remember, were extensions of the Joint Vision and Structured Dialogue Paper announced with the United States in July 2006. As agreed at the 3rd Economic Partnership Commission meeting held in February, an Action Plan was prepared between us and the United States. There was an agreement on this. This Action Plan contains various elements in the context of increasing cooperation between universities in the coming period, in the context of promoting cooperation between private sectors in the field of trade in general, in the field of investments, in the sense of encouraging the creative society, in the field of energy cooperation.
 
 This is the information I can share with you. Now, if you allow us, we can move on to your questions.
 
 ………………….
 
 QUESTION: Do you have any information on how the Turkish government will contribute to the 7th Framework Program with a budget?
 
 ANSWER: Not currently; but a more detailed explanation, as I said, is being sent to you today.
 
 QUESTION: Olli Rehn made a statement saying “We are against the establishment of Kurdistan” in a program he attended yesterday. However, Greece opened a consulate in Northern Iraq; In preparation for opening in England. Do you find these statements of Olli Rehn sincere?
 
 ANSWER: We naturally have to take the statements of an official representative of the European Commission seriously. It is an official statement. When it comes to opening a consulate, as you know, a country has various representations abroad. If we look at these in general terms, these are the Embassies that work in the capital of a country; They are the Consulate Generals opened after the decision is made jointly with that country and, of course, the Permanent Representations before international organizations. We see the consulates opened by other countries in Iraq within this framework. As a result, a Consulate General is opened before the Iraqi central government. There is no other aspect to it.
 
 QUESTION: About four months ago, a delegation went due to the construction problem between Palestine and Israel. However, despite all this time, no report has been released. Will this report be released? I don't know if it will be announced or not.
 
 ANSWER: You will remember that a statement was made to present this report to our Prime Ministry. That's why I'm asking you to direct your question there.
 
 QUESTION : We are receiving news that there are hot developments in Northern Iraq. How are these news evaluated in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? What kind of cooperation is there with the General Staff? Also, what is the level of dialogue with Kurdish leaders in Northern Iraq?
 
 ANSWER: A question was also asked to our Minister about the latest developments. Recently, there have been terrorist activities in Turkey resulting from the activities of the terrorist organization PKK, which unfortunately resulted in painful losses. As our Minister has stated, we have full coordination with the Turkish Armed Forces and our General Staff. We are working collaboratively on this issue. The measures that you mentioned that Turkey has taken are measures to ensure security at its borders.
 
 Regarding meeting with Iraqi leaders, as we always say, Turkey has never been a country that excludes the issue of dialogue. It is based primarily on peaceful approaches and dialogue in all its relations with the world. However, naturally, in order for us to take steps regarding dialogue, we need to receive positive signals in this regard. What we mean by positive signals is to take serious steps against the PKK terrorist organization. Otherwise, there is no meaning of dialogue just for dialogue.
 
 QUESTION: Before you started the press conference, there was news. That a Turkish truck was seized in the city of Sulaymaniyah in Northern Iraq, helicopter parts were found in it and the driver would be detained and brought to court. Have you had such a feeling?
 
 Answer is no. If our relevant units receive information on this matter, I will naturally check it after our meeting.
 
 QUESTION: There was an incident on Sunday, again in Northern Iraq, regarding the peshmerga's search for Turkish soldiers. The General Staff made a statement regarding this. What initiatives did the Ministry of Foreign Affairs take after this statement? If explanations were asked from the parties, it could be America, it could be those in Northern Iraq, what kind of answers were received?
 
 ANSWER: An attempt was made by the US Ambassador regarding this incident. This was also reflected in the press. We got a quick response on this. The next day, the US Embassy officials called our Ministry and informed us that necessary attempts, including the American commanders, had been taken to prevent such incidents from recurring.
 
 QUESTION: You said that you closely examined the transfer of authority in Northern Iraq last week. Has there been any contact about this? From your point of view, how did this devolution conclude?
 
 ANSWER: There is nothing to add to what I said last week. We are watching this matter very closely. Our view is clear. We consider this as a transfer of authority by the Iraqi Central Government to ensure security in the region. Beyond that, if there are factors that will disturb us, they are looked into.
 
 QUESTION: Is there any preparation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the developments in Northern Iraq? Because the cross-border operation is seriously discussed within the government and by the military. Is there such a study even at the preparatory stage?
 
 ANSWER: At the moment, we do not have a study on the preparation of a motion. But the Republic of Turkey is always ready for anything.
 
 QUESTION: The UN Secretary General, in a report he presented to the Security Council today, asked the parties to start negotiations again in Cyprus. When we consider the elections in Turkey and the upcoming elections on the island, how do you evaluate this call? Is it possible to resume talks within the framework of 8 July or directly?
 
 ANSWER: The report you refer to is one of the regular reports submitted by the UN Secretary-General to the Security Council on the activities of the UN Peacekeeping Force, which has been on the island since 1963. It is offered every six months. Because the Security Council extends the mandate of the Peace Corps on the island at six intervals, and such an activity report is submitted in advance so that it can extend it again. Of course, the Secretary General does not only mention the activities of the Peace Corps in this report; it also makes an assessment about the stage of the Cyprus problem. I haven't looked into the details of the report yet. But I can tell you that there is no change in Turkey's view of a negotiation process in Cyprus under the umbrella of the UN. Turkey, It believes that the Cyprus problem can be resolved comprehensively and that this comprehensive solution can only be found under the umbrella of the UN and only by taking these into account, without violating the basic parameters that the UN has developed over the course of nearly forty years of negotiation. Therefore, if the Secretary General makes a call to the parties, we always believe that the Turkish Cypriot side can conduct negotiations with the Greek Cypriot side on the basis of these parameters. The July 8 process was essentially a process between the parties in order to pave the way for these negotiations. However, as you know, unfortunately, we have not yet seen that the Greek Cypriot side has taken a positive step in this regard, despite the promises made. believes that they can be found by taking them into account. Therefore, if the Secretary General makes a call to the parties, we always believe that the Turkish Cypriot side can conduct negotiations with the Greek Cypriot side on the basis of these parameters. The July 8 process was essentially a process between the parties in order to pave the way for these negotiations. However, as you know, unfortunately, we have not yet seen that the Greek Cypriot side has taken a positive step in this regard, despite the promises made. believes that they can be found by taking them into account.

 Thank you very much. Keep up the good news."

It is obvious that this is a deliberate attack to further escalate sectarian conflicts and to prevent the reconciliation process in Iraq. 
 
 Turkey vigorously supports the national dialogue and the political reconciliation process towards the reinstitution of stability, peace, calm and prosperity in Iraq. 
 
 It is imperative that all the various political groups in Iraq act constructively and with common sense for the reconciliation process to succeed. Therefore, Turkey believes that the Iraqi groups must prevent this type of provocative actions which may lead to further bloodshed."

 Our country that has been fighting against PKK terrorism stresses in all its international, regional and bilateral contacts that, regardless of its roots, causes and alleged motives, terrorism cannot have any justification and should be condemned unreservedly. Turkey describes terrorism as a violation of the most fundamental human right, that is the right to life. 
 
 We believe that combating the scourge of terrorism which threatens international peace and security entails a unified, determined and coordinated response. We underline once again that Turkey is in solidarity with the British Government and the British people, and condemn these attempts in the strongest terms."

There is no official statement or statement to make today. That's why we can start taking your questions directly.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, has the arrival date of Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki been finalized? Can we get details about this visit? Who is he expected to meet, what issues are on the agenda?
 
 ANSWER: There is a visit by the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr. Maliki, to our country within the framework of the invitation of our Prime Minister. The visit is scheduled for the second week of August. It could probably be August 6, 7, 8, or play for a few days. Not finalized yet. Work on the program continues. What contacts Mr. Maliki will have during his stay in Turkey, and what elements his program will include has not been finalized yet. I think we will have the opportunity to share this with you in the next few days. Iraq is our neighbor, our friend and a country with which we have intense relations. All kinds of issues of our relations with Iraq, including trade and economic relations, will be on the agenda. During a Prime Ministerial visit,
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, will Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari accompany the Iraqi Prime Minister during his visit? Will Iraq's special envoy for the fight against PKK also visit Ankara?
 
 ANSWER: The list of delegations regarding the visit by Iraq has not been sent to us yet. They stated that they were forming the delegation list. Therefore, when the delegation list is finalized, I will be able to answer your question.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, perhaps the most discussed news of the past week was a claim made in the “Washington Post” that Turkey and the USA would conduct a covert operation against the PKK ringleaders. Was there any information in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this? Were you aware beforehand? If the news is true, how do you deal with the fact that it was leaked to the press? Also, Mesut Barzani today. He made a statement for the referendum on Kirkuk. The last day for the count is actually over. But there is still no concrete explanation for the postponement of the referendum. Massoud Barzani, on the other hand, says that this may be a cause of civil war. Considering Turkey's sensitivities regarding Kirkuk, what are your expectations regarding these statements and the referendum?
 
 ANSWER: If you want, let me first answer your question about Kirkuk. Kirkuk is a city in Iraq, as explained several times before by our senior officials and myself. This is how we see it, and we argue that the future of Kirkuk can only be decided with a consensus and a common understanding that will include the views of all groups within Iraq. Naturally, this is an internal matter of Iraq. As you know, holding a referendum in Kirkuk in accordance with the relevant article of the Iraqi constitution was on the agenda. The other day, there were news that the calendar set forth on this issue could not be implemented. We see this as an internal matter of Iraq, including the statements made by Barzani. But from the very beginning, Turkey has stated that if a referendum is to be held in Kirkuk, the necessary conditions must be met for this. We stated that it would be wrong to take a decision in line with the wishes of a single group, and that the whole of Iraq should decide on it. There has been no change in this view. As for your first question, I know there has been such speculation about comments in a US daily. I do not want to make any comments on this matter. I do not have any information about the accuracy or falsity of the news.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, Ankara has already made some contacts regarding the fact that the weapons of US origin are finally in the hands of the PKK organization in Iraq, including calling the US Ambassador to the Ministry. We know that in the past weeks, an official from the US Department of Defense also came and held talks. It seems that in the USA, they are faced with a very large problem. It's not just about the weapons that the PKK has seized. In some newspaper news, very large-scale weapons, tens of thousands are mentioned.. Is there any information reaching Ankara regarding the results of the ongoing investigation or its progress? What can you say about this?
 
 ANSWER: What you say is true. We know that the USA is conducting a comprehensive study on this issue. In addition, a legal adviser visited Ankara recently and made some contacts with both our Ministry and relevant authorities. I can say that these contacts are mostly at the preliminary stage. Other than that, in terms of content, there is nothing that I can share with you at this stage.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, a natural gas memorandum was signed with Iran shortly before the elections. Is there any development regarding this, will it be concluded? Because there are warnings about the embargo law, especially from the USA. Will any action be taken in this regard? Will the deal be signed?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, Turkey is a transit country for the international use of world energy resources. There are many pipeline projects passing through Turkey. These include energy resources such as oil and natural gas, and it is possible to build new ones. A memorandum of understanding has been signed with Iran and this does not in any way contradict the resolutions taken by the United Nations regarding Iran. Turkey will continue its policy regarding the transfer of energy resources to international markets and naturally to Turkey through diversified means.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, will Turkey contribute to the international peacekeeping force that will be established for Darfur in the form of financial support or military support?
 
 ANSWER: No decision has been taken on this issue yet. I can share detailed information with you later.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, as you know, Greek harassment and violations have been going on for a long time in the Aegean. You had a previous statement that initiatives were launched. However, no clear attempt was made on this issue to the public and the press, and we also know that these abuses and violations were made on some islands in the Aegean that needed to be disarmed. What are the initiatives in this regard? Can you explain these initiatives, and the lack of a clear initiative so far, at least not reflected in the press, does not strengthen the other side?
 
 ANSWER: I could not follow how much of the initiatives were reflected in the press. But I can tell you this. In case of any violation in the Aegean, necessary actions are taken immediately in Greece, both in Ankara and in Athens through our Embassy in Athens. These have become almost automatic until now. There is a difference of opinion between the two countries regarding the violations in the Aegean. This is a fact. This takes place on a ground that arises from Greece's interpretation of international law in its own way. It is not possible to say that the hand of Greece has become stronger. Because Turkey always records these violations both verbally and in writing and demands that they not be repeated.
 
 QUESTION: With the latest press law enacted in Greece, Turkish radios are also shut down. Have you had any initiative in Athens on this matter?
 
 ANSWER: It seems that a new press law has been prepared and approved in Greece. We are seriously examining the content of this law and we are evaluating its implications for the Western Thrace Turkish Minority. It is clear that this is not an appropriate law. I would also like to remind you that after the enactment of this law, the OSCE Media Freedom Representative made a statement on 27 July, stating that the new law imposes very harsh conditions especially for radio broadcasting and that this will put minority groups in trouble. After a comprehensive review of the law, an initiative will be taken before Greece in the coming days.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, one of the leaders of the terrorist organization PKK, Rıza Altun, although wanted by Interpol, was released by Austria and sent to Erbil. In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had initiatives before the Austrian Ambassador. I wonder if there was a response from the Austrian side in response to this initiative?
 
 ANSWER: I cannot say that we have received any satisfactory explanation from Austria. Although some justifications have been put forward by them, it is unacceptable for Austria to send a person wanted with the Interpol red notice and who also has a European Arrest Warrant to Iraq in this way. We have already filed a complaint against Austria before international organizations, especially the OSCE, as well as our initiatives before Austria. On the other hand, as you know, we have officially requested the Iraqi government to return the aforementioned person to Turkey within the framework of the existing legal assistance agreement between us. We have not yet received an answer.
 
 QUESTION: Could you tell me about the other organizations you complained about?
 
 ANSWER: It is being worked on. It will soon be in the presence of the United Nations.
 
 QUESTION: Will any economic or diplomatic steps be taken in terms of bilateral relations with Austria?
 
 ANSWER: These are still being evaluated.
 
 QUESTION: Do you think it was intentional?
 
 ANSWER: I can say that the explanation given by Austria so far is not satisfactory."
2007-09-08,8/9/2007,"9 Ağustos 2007, Dışişleri Bakanlığı Sözcüsü Levent Bilman’ın Haftalık Olağan Basın Toplantısı","9 August 2007, Weekly Ordinary Press Conference of Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Levent Bilman",https://www.mfa.gov.tr/9-agustos-2007_-disisleri-bakanligi-sozcusu-levent-bilman_in-haftalik-olagan-basin-toplantisi.tr.mfa,,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,PKK,0,1,"BİLMAN: Dear friends, welcome to our weekly press conference. Let me take your questions.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, the Greek Cypriot Administration had made some agreements and opened a tender to search for oil and natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean waters, the legitimacy of which Turkey considered controversial. This international tender expires on August 16. What path will Turkey follow from now on?
 
 BİLMAN: First of all, let me remind you of some things. Above all, Turkey is determined to protect its legitimate rights and interests in the Mediterranean. You will remember that as an extension of our determination regarding the attempts to limit the maritime jurisdiction areas and to grant oil and natural gas exploration licenses in the seas, initiated by the Greek Cypriot Administration in violation of international law and legitimacy, we have made attempts and recorded our views before international organizations and especially the United Nations. . I would also like to emphasize that this is nothing new. Turkey has expressed these views on every occasion. For example, in our opinions conveyed to the United Nations on March 2, 2004 and published as a UN document, it was stated that the attempts of the Greek Cypriot Administration to limit the maritime jurisdiction areas would not be accepted, and especially in the sea areas to the west of Cyprus Island in the Mediterranean Sea from 32 degrees 16 minutes 18 seconds east longitude. We had recorded at the time that Turkey also has legitimate rights and authorities. But as you know, the Greek Cypriot Administration insists on ignoring our warnings. On February 15, 2007, you will remember, it opened an international tender. Thereupon, we made the necessary warnings in the statement made by our Ministry and in the letters we submitted to the United Nations again. We also invited countries and companies that might be interested in this tender in the international arena to act responsibly and expressed our hope that they would not harm the efforts for a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem within the framework of the United Nations. I would like to reiterate that Turkey remains determined to protect its legitimate rights and interests.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, directly related to this issue, Turkey also had an attempt to initiate some seismic searches through TPAO. Can you give some information about this? When will the studies start or have they started?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, TPAO's seismic and oil exploration activities have been continuing regularly in the seas surrounding Turkey, in our territorial waters and, of course, on our continental shelf. If I'm not mistaken, you can check it from the Official Gazette today. In a few of the regions in the Eastern Mediterranean, which were determined to be within our continental shelf, the issues regarding the license petitions requested by TPAO for oil exploration were published. Therefore, TPAO's research studies in the Mediterranean continue.
 
 QUESTION: You know that yesterday an energy agreement was signed between the Iraqi government and Turkey, that is, a memorandum of understanding. Within this framework, there will be some investments between the Iraqi government and Iraq and Turkey. In which regions will Turkey's investments in Iraq be made? What regions in Iraq will this cover?
 
 ANSWER: During the visit of Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki, such an agreement was signed between the Energy Ministers of the two countries. But it would be better to ask our relevant authorities for details about which regions this will actually cover. I don't have these.
 
 QUESTION: There is a missile crisis between Russia and Georgia, and in this context, the parties, or more precisely, the following news emerged: Turkey's own radar system was capable of controlling or monitoring the flights on that date, allegedly, and therefore, opinions and information were obtained from Turkey. that may be requested. I wonder if such a request came from the parties, how would you look at it?
 
 ANSWER: We have not received any official request regarding this matter.
 
 QUESTION: Recently, it has been stated on various Kurdish administration websites that 350 Turkish commandos entered Northern Iraq and took positions. My first question is is this true? Secondly, do the point operations still continue to Iraq? In the context of hot pursuit, of course.
 
 ANSWER: This type of news appears from time to time in some media. You know, most of them are speculative. I cannot comment on these. But you know that Turkey has declared to the world that it will make every effort to ensure the security of its border with Iraq. These studies are ongoing.
 
 QUESTION: It is said that a bill has been prepared in the American House of Representatives for the withdrawal of Turkish soldiers from Cyprus. What would you like to say about this, especially with the pressure of the Greek and Greek lobby? Also, does the Turkish Foreign Ministry have anything to say about the South Koreans taken hostage in Afghanistan?
 
 ANSWER: This type of resolution is presented to the American Congress from time to time within the framework of the lobbying efforts of a certain interest group. These have happened in the past. You'll remember that all of this is outdated. Before the congress closes, such draft resolutions are hastily presented in the last working days. As I just mentioned, these are things that appeal to certain interest groups. Naturally, I have to remind some things on this occasion. As you know, Turkey maintains military units in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus within the framework of its legitimate rights arising from international agreements. Dear members of the congress who submitted these resolutions, that there are more than 7,000 Greek soldiers on the island and, essentially, Officer in the army of the Greek Cypriot side, which should have been illegal according to the 1960 agreements,
 
 Regarding your second question, Turkey follows with great concern the issue of South Korean nationals held hostage in Afghanistan. Our hope is that these citizens will get out of this situation safely and return to their countries as soon as possible. Turkey is in contact with both the South Korean authorities and the Afghan authorities.
 
 QUESTION: I would like to return to the subject of Iraq again. Within the framework of the energy agreement, simultaneously with Maliki's visit to Ankara, the Federal Kurdistan Government Parliament passed a law regarding their own regions, the oil law. On October 3, 2006, MIT had a warning about this law, both to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Energy. In this warning, there were warnings that if such a law were passed, Kirkuk's oil could fall into the hands of the Kurdish administration without the need for a referendum. Now, at this stage, what kind of path will Turkey follow as a country that has signed such an agreement with Iraq?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, an oil law needs to be passed by the national assembly and the central government in Iraq, taking the opinions of all Iraq's relevant groups. What is important for us and important for the international community and for international companies is that the central government and the central parliament make this decision. Apart from this, it would not be right to comment on such decisions made by regional governments. The important thing for us, as I said, is that the Iraqi oil law, which has not yet been fully agreed upon, is passed by the Iraqi national assembly. However, necessary actions are taken after that.
 
 QUESTION: There are comments that the memorandum of understanding signed during Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's visit to Ankara and a future counter-terrorism agreement should be supported by the regional administration in Kurdistan in order to yield results. First of all, do you agree with these comments and will there be any contact with Barzani in the coming period? Do you think it should be?
 
 ANSWER: A memorandum of understanding was signed by the two Prime Ministers during the Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's visit to our country. As you said, within the framework of this memorandum, the two sides have committed to finalizing and signing the draft anti-terrorism agreement within two months. I think the answer to your question was given indirectly by Mr. Prime Minister Maliki at the press conference. To a question directed to him, he replied that this agreement would bind the whole of Iraq. My answer will be in the same direction.
 
 QUESTION: Our interlocutor in Northern Iraq and terrorism was the USA. Now, with the arrival of Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki, has our interlocutor changed?
 
 ANSWER: Our interlocutor in the fight against Northern Iraq and the terror originating from Northern Iraq was never the United States alone. I would like to remind you that we gave our note to the Iraqi government about ending the terror against our country from Northern Iraq.
 
 QUESTION: With regard to Iraq, is it possible to implement a tripartite mechanism to solve the PKK problem, after Maliki's visit?
 
 ANSWER: We do not have any preparations for this at the moment. As you know, the memorandum of understanding foresees the signing of a counter-terrorism agreement. Probably better to wait for it first.
 
 QUESTION: There is a thirst disaster in Ankara these days. Do you have any requests from foreign missions in Ankara? Any contact with them, I don't know about this issue, but it could also be technical.
 
 ANSWER: At the moment, I do not have any information, of course, we will investigate it for you, but as far as I know, there has been no contact with our Ministry in this regard. But if there is, of course, we will see and share it with you.
 
 QUESTION: I will ask two follow-up questions to last week's meeting. First, you said that participation in the Darfur Peace Force is being evaluated, has a result been achieved? Secondly, you said that the Greek press law has been investigated and you will take initiatives if necessary, has there been any development?
 
 ANSWER: First of all, I would like to answer Darfur. Turkey has been following this tragedy in Darfur closely for a long time and is doing its best. You will remember that in 2006, during his visit to Sudan, our Prime Minister also visited Darfur. Essentially, a field hospital in Darfur, Turkey, has been operating since August 2006. In addition, we are still working on transforming this hospital into a permanent hospital. Again, I would like to remind you that in the past, an aircraft belonging to our air force was assigned to the rotation of African Union Force soldiers stationed in Darfur. Turkey also contributed financially. As you have just stated, the United Nations Security Council called for a large military force to be deployed in Darfur in a very comprehensive way in order to contribute to the solution. At the moment it appears that this will be a military, police mixed force; We also understand that the African Union Force will work together with the United Nations force. There is talk of a union of 26,000 people. Turkey is still in the evaluation phase of this issue. We will determine this as soon as possible in consultation with the relevant parties in the international arena. Of course, our greatest wish is for the problem in Darfur to be resolved as soon as possible to the satisfaction of all parties involved. We also understand that the African Union Force will work together with the United Nations force. There is talk of a union of 26,000 people. Turkey is still in the evaluation phase of this issue. We will determine this as soon as possible in consultation with the relevant parties in the international arena. Of course, our greatest wish is for the problem in Darfur to be resolved as soon as possible to the satisfaction of all parties involved. We also understand that the African Union Force will work together with the United Nations force. There is talk of a union of 26,000 people. Turkey is still in the evaluation phase of this issue. We will determine this as soon as possible in consultation with the relevant parties in the international arena. Of course, our greatest wish is for the problem in Darfur to be resolved as soon as possible to the satisfaction of all parties involved.
 
 As I said in the last press conference about the Radio and Television Law adopted in Greece, although our evaluations are still ongoing, let me emphasize some points. This is an issue that closely concerns the Western Thrace Turkish Minority. The Minority Advisory Board, which is the highest advisory body of the Western Thrace Turkish Minority, made a statement on this issue on 2 August 2007. He stated that this law closely concerns the minority whose mother tongue is Turkish according to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne and poses a serious threat to the activities of minority radios broadcasting in Turkish. He demanded that this law, which does not comply with the European Union norms and other international standards and restricts the freedom of the press, be reviewed. Similarly, the press freedom representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe made a statement. I mentioned this at my last press conference. We think that the Greek Media License Law adopted in Greece, an EU member, should not constitute a new opportunity for violation of the rights and freedoms of the Western Thrace Turkish minority stemming from bilateral and multilateral agreements. Attempts are being made before the Greek authorities.
 
 QUESTION: Recently, former US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke made a definition about Turkey and said it is a moderate Islamic country and compared Turkey with Malaysia. I wonder how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs looks at the definition of a moderate Islamic country, do you agree with it, how do you evaluate Holbrooke's assessment and the comparison of Malaysia and Turkey?
 
 ANSWER: I cannot comment on the statements made by a resigned Foreign Minister through the press. The constitutional structure of Turkey is clear.
 
 QUESTION: In Maliki's delegation, there was also the Minister of National Security of Iraq, Vaili, and he had meetings with Mr. Rafet Akgünay at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The USA on both sides showed their will at the same time regarding the closure of the Mahmur camp, I think this issue has come to the fore. Could you give some information about the closing process of the Mahmur camp? Also, Mr. Akgünay and Mr. Ralston, I think, 3 months have passed and no official meeting has been held yet, I was going to find out why. I wonder if Mr. Akgünay will accompany our Undersecretary's visit to Washington, is there a separate meeting with Ralston here?
 
 ANSWER: Our Deputy Undersecretary Ambassador Akgünay had a meeting with Minister El Vaili accompanying Prime Minister Maliki's visit. However, this meeting was a short meeting and was in the nature of an introductory meeting. There has been no recent contact with Ralston.
 
 QUESTION: There is a short time left before the projected time for the Kirkuk referendum. What is the approach of Turkey, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the establishment of a special administration in the Kirkuk region and even a Turkmen autonomous region in this region, can it support such a formation?
 
 ANSWER: Your question is more based on conjecture. In Iraq, the parameters regarding Kirkuk are clear, as stipulated by the constitution. There is no change in our view. We are of the opinion that the future of Kirkuk will be determined by the joint decision of all Iraqi groups, and if a referendum is to be held in Kirkuk, we believe that it should be done not by the will of a single group, but by the joint decision of all Iraqi people and the groups that make up Iraq. In order for this to happen, certain conditions had to be met. These conditions have not been met to date.
 
 QUESTION: Until today, that is, it could be within the framework of Maliki's visit or outside of it. Has there been any demand from the Iraqi central government to Turkey to declare a general amnesty for the PKK elements and militants of the terrorist organization PKK, has an expectation been conveyed, has this issue ever been discussed in the negotiations?
 
 ANSWER: As far as I know, there is no such thing.
 
 QUESTION: There are some reports that Greek-flagged ships violate Turkish waters. What's the latest?
 
 ANSWER: We also saw these news and did a research. There is no change in Turkey's previous decision regarding the entry of Greek-flagged ships into Turkish ports, which has been implemented until today. I would like to specifically point this out. Of course, it's also worth remembering that. Thousands of entrances are made to Turkish ports, and some of them can submit different documents when they apply for an entry permit through shipping agencies, benefiting from the fact that the ship is registered in two different countries. Of course, necessary contacts were made with our relevant authorities to examine them more carefully.
 
 I understand there is no further question. Thank you for coming. I wish you all to catch good and good news. Thank you."

 The terrorist nature of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL was confirmed in the “Memorandum of Understanding” that was signed on 7 August 2007 by the Prime Ministers of the two countries during the visit of the Iraqi delegation headed by Prime Minister Maliki and in which Minister Zebari also was present. 
 
 The “Agreement on Combatting Terrorism” which is referred to in the signed Memorandum, is a draft which has been worked on since May 2006 between Our Government and the Government of Mr. Maliki, of which Hoshyar Zebari is a member, and was agreed upon to a great extent until the day of the visit. Therefore, the said draft Agreement cannot be considered as a fait accompli imposed on the Iraqi side. 
 
 Furthermore, the draft of the “Memorandum of Understanding on Combatting Terrorism and Organized Crime”, a text of technical nature and was envisaged to be signed during the visit, is a text drafted by the Iraqi Government itself and has been largely accommodated by us. 
 
 In light of the existing good neighborly relations between the two countries, Turkey expects the Iraqi Government to fulfill its internationally agreed commitements, first and foremost those that fall under United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding the fight against terrorism and pursues the steps the Iraqi Government will take in this respect."

 Today we host the US Department of State Condoleeza Rice in Ankara. Mr. Rice arrived in Ankara in the morning. He had a meeting with our Prime Minister Mr. We had a meeting with him a little while ago, here at our Ministry. Then we will visit our President together. During our visit and meetings this morning, we discussed with Mr. Rice especially the problems that concern two countries and in our region: the situation in Iraq, the situation in Northern Iraq, the issues related to the PKK terrorist organization and regional issues related to the Middle East Peace Process, such as Lebanon, which also concern both countries. we got it. At the same time, we also evaluated together the current situation in the American Congress regarding the 1915 events. In our meetings, we once again confirmed that the goals and objectives of both countries are the same in many issues. USA is friendly to us, We are an ally country and at the same time our strategic partner. Within the framework of this understanding, we are in agreement to deal with all these problems together and to produce solutions. Since we have very little time, I give the floor to Mr. Rice without further ado.
 
 MR. RICE: Thank you very much, Minister Ali. Thank you very much for having me here. I want to begin just by noting, since we are here in the Foreign Ministry, that a few days ago, Mr. Inonu, who was the Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of Turkey, passed away after a long illness. He passed away in Houston. He was a good friend of the United States and a true patriot for Turkey. And I want to offer my condolences to the Turkish people and to his family. As my colleague has said, we've had wide-ranging discussions with the Prime Minister and then in our own channels, and we will continue those discussions. I want to take a moment to thank you very much for hosting the meeting that we are about attend in Istanbul, the neighbors conference. Turkey has been a good friend of the United States and a good friend of Iraq. And we appreciate very much that you are going to host that conference. We've had wide-ranging discussions about Iran, about Lebanon. We talked about the Middle East peace process. I know that Ali has just been from a 12-country tour of the region, and so he had a lot of updated information to give me. And of course, we've had a significant discussion of the problems in northern Iraq and the problem of PKK terrorism. And I affirmed to the Prime Minister as well as to the Foreign Minister that the United States considers the PKK a terrorist organization and indeed we have a common enemy that we must find ways to take effective action so that Turkey will not suffer from terrorist attacks. That is destabilizing for Iraq; it is a problem therefore of security for the United States and Turkey, and we will work together to achieve our goals.
 
 OUR MINISTER: Dear friends, we are now taking two questions each and after that, we ask your permission immediately.
 
 Two questions for me, two questions for the Minister.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Rice, Turkey has been working with the United States for a long time and is waiting for something to be done about PKK terrorism. When you last met with Prime Minister Erdogan, you said that you would present some proposals to Ankara in a few days. Is there any suggestion that the USA and Turkey should do together against the PKK, which you brought to Turkey on your tour today? And when do you expect results?
 
 MR. RICE: Well, I first confirmed and affirmed with the Prime Minister that we consider this a common threat, not just a threat to Turkey, but a threat to the interest of the United States as well. We are indeed talking about how to enhance some of the activities that we have already begun in terms of information sharing, intelligence sharing. But we want to look to a plan for effective action against the PKK. It will require not just the United States and Turkey, but also the Iraqi Government, and that is a discussion that I plan to have when I see Prime Minister Maliki later on today. The President will meet with Prime Minister Erdogan on November 5th and they will be able to further our discussions. I did want to hear from my Turkish colleagues about their ideas and about how we might move this forward. But I want to just underscore again, this is going to take persistence, it's going to take commitment. This is a very difficult problem. Rooting out terrorism is hard. We are learning that all around the world. But with commitment and with persistence, I'm certain we'll be able to make progress. And we want to do so in a way that improves the prospects for a stable and democratic Iraq on the border with Turkey because ultimately, as my Turkish colleagues have said many times, a unified and stable Iraq is very much in Turkey's interest as well as in the interest of the region.
 
 QUESTION: A question for each of you. For the Foreign Minister, what would you like to see the US do that is not doing now to confront the PKK rebels and did you ask Secretary Rice for anything specific in your meeting today and Madam Secretary, your former envoy for the border region in the PKK, General Ralston is recorded today as saying US inaction on the PKK matter may drive Turkey to act. Has the US been to slow to react here and are you planning to catch up now?
 
 OUR MINISTER: Let me answer the first question right away. As you know, there are many instruments in the fight against terrorism. We have been a victimized country for years by the attacks of the PKK terrorist organization and we lost thousands of our citizens in these attacks. What we expect is cooperation and solidarity from all our friends, the whole international community, in the fight against terrorism. This collaboration can be in very different formats, there can be very different instruments. The important thing here is to use all these instruments in a timely manner in a coordinated manner with a strategic approach. Today's visit of Mr. Rice, my dear friend Condi, should be considered as the beginning of a closer cooperation with the USA in the fight against terrorism in the coming period. This is how we view it, Undoubtedly, the continuation of these talks will continue in Washington on Monday, and we hope and wish that the USA, which has been the target of major terrorist acts, understands the situation we are in, is aware of the troubled situation we are in, and is aware of the anger we feel, which we clearly saw during this visit. What is important now is the continued direct interest in this issue at the highest level of the administration in the USA in the next period, and solidarity and cooperation in the fight against this terrorist organization by using very different methods in many different instruments.
 
 MR. RICE: We have taken several steps over the last -- particularly the last several months of the last year to enhance our ability to cooperate together in the sharing of intelligence and the sharing of information, in the way that we assess the situation. But I think it's fair to say that we believe, the President believes -- and he will say to Prime Minister Erdogan -- that we all need to redouble our efforts. And the United States is committing to -- committed to redoubling those efforts because we need a comprehensive approach to this problem. I want to repeat that all across the world, we're seeing that it is not easy to root out terrorists who hide in remote areas and hide in villages. It's a hard problem and so we need a comprehensive approach. The Prime Minister has talked about a comprehensive plan and we started to talk about some of the elements of that today. And when he is in Washington, I think that they will talk more about those elements. But no one should doubt the commitment of the United States to this issue because, as I've underscored, this is not just a problem for Turkey. This is a problem for Iraq, this is a problem for the United States. And so we have a common enemy and we need a common approach to dealing with the problem that we find ourselves -- with the problem with which we find ourselves. This is a problem for Iraq, this is a problem for the United States. And so we have a common enemy and we need a common approach to dealing with the problem that we find ourselves -- with the problem with which we find ourselves. This is a problem for Iraq, this is a problem for the United States. And so we have a common enemy and we need a common approach to dealing with the problem that we find ourselves -- with the problem with which we find ourselves.
 
 QUESTION: In your statement before Mr. Rice arrived, you said that you will try to discourage Turkish officials from a possible military operation in Iraq against an operation that may destabilize Iraq. However, you will appreciate that stability in Iraq has been deteriorated since America entered there. Turkey is waiting for concrete steps. You also mentioned Northern Iraq as Kurdistan a few times. Is this a statement made specifically or a slip of the tongue, we know that you are emphasizing the territorial integrity of Iraq. We would also like to talk about the issue in the American Congress regarding the 1915 events. You've had conversations on this subject. Turkey is constantly perceived as a counter trump card from the United States. It comes to the agenda in the same way every year and there is a reactionary environment, will you have an explanation on this matter?
 
 MR RICE: Well, first of all, on the House resolution and the events of 1915, I think it's clear, and we've received from our Turkish colleagues an expression of gratitude for how hard the United States Government worked to see that this resolution would not pass, not because we are unconcerned about the historical events (inaudible) there, where they were tragic and brutal events, but because we do not believe that this resolution would have served any good purpose. And we're going to continue to work against the resolution. We are encouraging Turkey and Armenia to come together both to address their history, but also to address their future, because these two countries are going to prosper better in a circumstance in which there are relations between Turkey and Armenia. And so that would be our hope. As to northern Iraq, nobody is a stronger supporter of a unified Iraq than the United States and than I am, on behalf of the United States. There is a Kurdish Regional Government. We expect that Kurdish Regional Government to exercise its responsibilities as well for what happens in territory in which it is governing. But the north of Iraq and all of Iraq are part of a single, unified Iraq. The United States does not stand for the partition of Iraq. I said this yesterday to a group of Iraqis. And I would just note that I haven't heard Iraqis talking about a partition of their own country, and so obviously the territorial integrity is important. As to the stability of northern Iraq and of this region, it is absolutely the case that there cannot be terrorism emanating from that territory or it will contribute to instability in northern Iraq.
 
 QUESTION: Thank you. Nicholas Kralev of The Washington Times. I'd like to ask both of you what role can Iran play in resolving the PKK issue? They have been supportive of Turkey. Is this an opportunity to engage Iran perhaps in a constructive way? And Madame Secretary, a point you made on the plane flying over here that the PKK problem is not -- does not date back to yesterday or the war, but does, in fact, go back decades. As you know, there is a widely held view in Turkey that the war in Iraq has created conditions that have helped the PKK. Were you in your comments yesterday trying to avoid perhaps responsibility for the conditions you might have created that have helped the PKK?
 
 OUR MINISTER: Dear friends, Iran is our neighbor and Iran is a country that, like the PKK terrorist organization, is subject to the attacks of another terrorist organization called PJAK. And everyone knows the connection between these two organizations, the PKK and PJAK. We have undoubtedly evaluated the PKK-related issues both during our visit to Tehran and Mr. Muttaki's visit to Turkey by the Iranian Foreign Minister. They have shared some ideas with us about what kind of support and what kind of contribution they can provide, and this conversation is of course ongoing. However, I want to make it clear that there is currently an American presence throughout Iraq. There is an American domination. The central government of Iraq has no facilities in the north. The North has no flags, no soldiers. And although the central government's intentions are good, Opportunities Opportunities to fight the PKK are very limited. On the other hand, we have doubts about the political will of the formation in the North and the administration in the North in the fight against the PKK. The statements they make are statements of tacit support and sympathy for a terrorist organization. Therefore, we need a structure that will combine political will and physical means in our fight against the PKK. Therefore, we have great expectations from the USA in this regard. The US administration is the party that will play a key role if we are to fight the PKK, and it should not have worked on methods, results and solutions that will bring effective results and include action in the next period. Now we are where the words end. We are where the action should begin. I thank you again for your interest and participation.

 MR RICE: Yes, very briefly. First of all, I think it is historically accurate that this is not a problem of the last few years. There have been times when PKK activism has been very strong. I fully acknowledge that the circumstances are different today because there is a US role, and I have said a US obligation, to help to do something about the problem of the PKK in northern Iraq. In fact, it's something that we stated at the time of the liberation of Iraq, that the United States would not tolerate the use of Iraqi territory for terrorist activity. So I think that should be very clear. Again, the United States and Turkey and Iraq, even if it has limited capabilities, and the regional government has a common interest in not having the events in northern Iraq lead into a destabilization of Iraq as a whole. And so I am quite certain that we can find ways to cooperate for effective action. We also want to see action. We want it to be effective, we want it to be well-considered and we want it to be action that is going to really help us to get a handle on what has been a festering problem and, frankly, lately, with PKK attacks a more acute problem."

Dear members of the press, welcome to our regular weekly press conference. I would like to begin my speech by reminding a statement we made yesterday afternoon. Maybe it escaped your notice. As you know, on September 14, the meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Southeast European Cooperation Process will be held in the city of Plovdiv in Bulgaria and in Sofia. We will attend this meeting with a delegation under the chairmanship of our Minister. The main purpose of this meeting will be the signing of the host country agreement on the establishment of the Secretariat of the Regional Cooperation Council in Sarajevo, which will replace the Stability Pact, which has a very important position in regional cooperation, and will have a more comprehensive and effective structure. Thus, The Southeast European Cooperation Process will be institutionalized and the relationship between the Southeast European Countries Cooperation Process and the Regional Cooperation Council will be reinforced. I would like to bring this to your attention once again. Now we can move on to your questions.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, Mr. Minister, in his statement this week, it was stated that an attempt was made to violate the airspace in Israel. Did this attempt get any results? Also, is the justification for this attempt the violation of Syrian airspace by Israeli planes? Or is it also a violation of Turkish airspace? I would like to ask you for a detail, I wonder how long this violation lasted? Did the Turkish Security Forces respond to the violation?
 
 ANSWER: Friends, there are two statements made by our Minister on this subject, on the occasion of the Syrian Foreign Minister's visit to our country, and a few days before that, while he was leaving for Portugal, at the airport. I have nothing more to add to these explanations for now. But to repeat, we have stated that we are watching these developments with concern, and we have emphasized that necessary initiatives are being taken by Israel. Necessary contacts with Israel were made through diplomatic channels and between our relevant authorities, and these contacts are still ongoing. It would not be correct for me to answer the technical details of the violation you mentioned.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Levent, all air violations are normally posted on the General Staff's website. Now, when it is obvious that these fuel tanks are on the border of Hatay, that is, within the borders of Turkey, how do you evaluate why there is no such information on the General Staff website?
 
 ANSWER: I am not the addressee of this question. After all, the important thing is to make the necessary contacts between the relevant institutions and these contacts have been made.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, it is a continuation, then is there a consensus with the Air Force Command or the General Staff about the violation?
 
 ANSWER: Friends, there has been a natural coordination with our relevant authorities. Our Minister has clearly expressed this. All of our institutions are active in this regard. Beyond that, there is nothing more to say.
 
 QUESTION: I want to move on to another topic. The British The Daily Telegraph had a report that US officers were meeting with PKK leaders on Qandil Mountain. I wonder if you are evaluating these news on this subject, have you had any initiative in America? Did you ask for an explanation from America and what is your approach to this news? In addition, I wonder if there are some information and allegations coming to Ankara in this direction, whether it is the Turkish intelligence units in the region or the authorities in the region.
 
 ANSWER: Let me start with your last question. As you mentioned in your question, we are talking about intelligence issues. It wouldn't be right to talk about them openly like that. Intelligence information is intelligence information. As for the second issue, our Ministry contacted the American Embassy in Ankara, naturally, after such news appeared in the press that the USA was talking to some terrorist organization leaders and some officials on Mount Kandil. As you may have seen, he made a statement on the same day through the Press Office of the American Embassy and stated that there was no such thing, that these were fictitious and fabricated news. Our expectation from the whole world, especially from our allies, is the restriction of all activities of the PKK, which has naturally been declared a terrorist organization,
 
 QUESTION: Levent Bey, one week after the meeting with Talat, 1-2 months after the statements of the new Foreign Minister in Cyprus, Papadopoulos made some statements targeting the Turkish army. He described it as an enemy and occupying power. Does Ankara have an opinion on this issue?
 
 ANSWER: I saw these statements of the Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos this morning, too. It seems that Turkey does not quite understand its relations with the Island. I think he seems to have forgotten that Turkey is a guarantor country along with Greece and England, that Turkey is also the Motherland and that the existence of the Turkish Armed Forces on the Island is due to international agreements and is legal. It should also be reminded that declaring the Turkish Armed Forces as an enemy in this way does not serve peace in any way. Targeting the Turkish Armed Forces in this way is unacceptable. The Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos must now understand these.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, there were counter-terrorism coordinators. As you know, Turkey and the USA. I wonder if Rafet Bey had any contact with Ralston? It didn't happen a few months ago though. Any last developments?
 
 ANSWER: I have no information about any recent contact, no.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hosyar Zebari also made some statements yesterday. We didn't want an agreement, so he blamed Ankara for not having a relationship with the Kurds in Iraq, and said that because of this, there could not be a fight against terrorism. Can we get your evaluations on this matter?
 
 ANSWER: We carefully evaluated the statements of the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mr. Zebari, published in one of our media. We would like to remind you that the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding with our Prime Minister during the visit of the Iraqi government delegation, of which Mr. Zebari is a member, to Turkey at the Prime Minister level. It is important for us to implement the elements included in this memorandum of understanding. On the other hand, as you know, we are in talks with all groups in Iraq. We've said this many times. We do not have any problems with this. However, it should not be forgotten that the interlocutor of the Republic of Turkey in its contacts and cooperation with Iraq is the Iraqi Central Government.
 
 QUESTION: Continuing with the question, Mr. Levent, there was a remarkable part in Zebari's statements. In other words, the delegation that will come there, that is, the delegation from the regional government in the North, will participate as part of the Iraqi delegation under the Iraqi flag. But as it can be understood from the same expressions, it is said that the government objected to this being so and did not accept it. Is there such an objection?
 
 ANSWER: You are talking about the tripartite committee that the Iraqi Foreign Minister Mr. Zebari referred to in his statements. Although this committee has been established, we have not seen a productive work until today. So I think we have overcome those issues. We are currently in a process that has signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding with Iraq and the Iraqi government has also signed it. Our expectation is to implement the elements in this memorandum of understanding. Of course, by the way, I would like to remind you that Mr. Zebari himself stated that they are bound by the said Memorandum of Understanding in the statements he made in Iraq and Baghdad after his visit to Turkey.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, there is various information regarding Iraq that the referendum in Kirkuk was postponed to May 2008. Do you have any information coming in this direction? Also, has the level of the expanded Iraq meeting announced to be held at the end of October become clear? So are we waiting for leaders? For example, at what level will Iraq participate?
 
 ANSWER: Let me answer your last question right away. As you know, the Neighboring Countries Process had a meeting in Baghdad last Sunday at the level of high-level civil servants. Our country was also represented at this meeting, and as it was clearly stated in the published statement of this meeting, it was decided to hold the next Neighboring Countries expanded format meeting in Istanbul between 31 October-1 November. This meeting is at the level of Foreign Ministers. Invitations are made at the level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Naturally, it is a task for the countries to determine their level of representation at this meeting. However, the level of the meeting is at the level of Foreign Ministers. As for the Kirkuk issue, as far as I know, no official statement has been made by Iraq regarding the postponement of the referendum. As you will remember, Holding a referendum in Kirkuk is an article in the Constitution. But various, as you refer, we have also received information that this referendum has been postponed. There is no change in our approach to Kirkuk. We believe that the future of Kirkuk should be determined by a consensus by the entire Iraqi people, by the groups that make up the whole of Iraq. We are against the determination of the future of Kirkuk by actions taken by only one group, in line with the interests of only one group.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, I have a question about the EU and Cyprus. After a long time, Mr. Minister met with his European counterparts for the first time in Portugal as Chief Negotiator. We know that the meeting also included various bilateral meetings, and today Olli Rehn has also made a statement in the press about the change of 301. Considering that the progress report is soon to be published in the upcoming period, do you have some concrete goals regarding the reform process? 301 change is on the agenda? Also, I have a question regarding Cyprus. I wonder if Turkey is considering opening its ports to the Greek part?
 
 ANSWER: During his first visit to Portugal as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister Çavuşoğlu had the opportunity to discuss every issue with his interlocutors. As you know, the main topic of the meeting held in Portugal was the Middle East process. But naturally, Turkey's EU membership process was also discussed in bilateral contacts. It is worth noting here. Our government members, especially our Minister himself, have declared several times that Turkey's path is always clear, and that our government embraces the reforms with full determination. Lastly, our Minister emphasized this again on your question. As you know, a program covering the years 2007-2013 was also announced. As our Minister has stated, the Assembly is on recess at the moment. After the end of the parliamentary recess, work will continue within the framework of a calendar. As for the Cyprus issue, as you know, the issue of Turkey's opening its ports to the Greek Cypriot Administration has been the scene of long discussions. Our view on this matter is clear. Our determination in this matter continues. Naturally, it should be reminded that those who remind Turkey of its obligations within the framework of the EU should also remember their own obligations. Regarding the Turkish Cypriots, the EU has still not been able to implement the decisions it took in 2004. Turkish Cypriots still live under international isolation and embargoes. Those who remind us of our obligations should also remember them.

 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, Hoşyar Zebari's statement in Cumhuriyet newspaper, reflected there, contains a sentence such as ""We rejected Turkey's demands"". What is meant here was our demands before, regarding the fight against PKK terrorism. Does he mean them? So did they have an official statement to us? Can you give me information about this?
 
 ANSWER: Sure. I didn't quite understand what Mr. Zebari meant. Because, during this visit, both sides made an effort in good faith to bring a few agreements to this visit. The economic treaty and the counter-terrorism treaty. The drafts of this agreement were exchanged between the two countries quite a long time ago. Negotiations were ongoing. A few issues had to be finalized. Our desire was to finalize them during this visit and try to complete an agreement here. However, it was not possible to finalize it, but within two months, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding at the level of prime ministers to finalize these agreements. Therefore, our expectation is again in this direction.
 
 QUESTION : Mr. Levent, in addition, a delegation was originally expected to arrive within 15 days from the Ministry of Interior, but you know that delegation could not come. Is there a new calendar for that delegation? Do you at least know? You said in two months. Time flies fast, will he be able to catch up?
 
 ANSWER: Under the Presidency of the Iraqi Minister of Interior, there was an agreement for a high-level visit to Turkey. It's true what you said. But as you know, there were very serious developments regarding the government in Iraq at that time. Some groups withdrew from the government. We understand that there are some internal difficulties in Iraq's taking steps in this regard. But let me put it as much as we've been told. There is political will for the realization of these visits. Both we and they bear the desire to conclude these agreements in the coming period.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, the ongoing case in Belgium regarding the PKK's money has been concluded in the past weeks. As far as I remember, you also made an attempt before the Belgian authorities. At least they are on the way that their money will not be returned to the PKK. Is the appeal against this open at least by the Belgian authorities? Will it be possible to prevent the money from returning to PKK members? Another extension of this case. Will the blockade regarding the sapphire stones in Zurich continue?
 
 ANSWER: Thank you. This issue is among the topics that we follow closely. You know, and we also made a statement. The appeal is open. We regret that the court in Belgium dismissed this case on grounds such as the statute of limitations.
 
 Yes, I understand that there is no other question, thank you for coming, I wish you good and good news."

 In an interview published in the Arabic Al-Sharq Al-Awsat newspaper of London on 30 January 2008, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq Mr. Behram Saleh is reported to have asserted that he came to an agreement with Minister Babacan that the operations carried out by the Turkish Armed Forces against the PKK terrorist organization established in the North of Iraq, constituted a violation of the sovereignty of Iraq. Such an assertion is entirely false. 
 
 In that meeting Minister Babacan explained that the problem is the establishment of the PKK terrorist organization in northern Iraq; and that this situation is incompatible with good neighborly relations between Turkey and Iraq. He stressed that our military operations would continue until the presence in the North of Iraq of the PKK, which is accepted and declared by the whole world as a terrorist organization, is eradicated.

 The text of the decision is being evaluated in detail. An initial examination reveals that the Court has not expressed an opinion on whether the PKK/KONGRA-GEL is a terrorist organisation, but on whether the process by which it was included into the EU list of terrorist organizations was consistent with EU law. 
 
 The PKK, together with all its other names (KADEK, KONGRA-GEL etc.), continues to be on the terrorist organizations list annexed to the 20 December 2007 decision of the EU Council, which is still valid. 
 
 In this respect, the claims of proponents of the terrorist organisation that the PKK/KONGRA-GEL has been taken off the EU terrorist organisations list do not reflect the truth. It is known that despite similar decisions taken in the past by the said Court regarding the process of inclusion in the EU list of some other terrorist organizations, these continue to be on the EU Council list as terrorist organisations.

I am sure you share this sadness with the Foreign Affairs community. As always, I'll make a couple of announcements and then I'll try to answer your questions.
 
 I would like to inform you about the visit of the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs to our country. At the invitation of Foreign Minister Ali Babacan, Dutch Foreign Minister Verhagen will pay a working visit to our country on 10 October, tomorrow. Within the framework of the visit, there is a memorandum of understanding signed last March - a memorandum of understanding on strengthening relations between the two countries - a series of conferences was established in accordance with this memorandum. The second of these conferences will be held in Ankara.
 
 You are naturally invited to the opening part of the conference, which will start with the opening speeches of both Ministers at 9.30 tomorrow morning, that is, the part where the ministers will make speeches. Image can be taken. It will be held here at the Fatin Rüştü Zorlu Hall in our ministry. Two working groups will be established within the conference. These working groups, the first of which will be on regional and international security issues, and the second on energy issues, will consist of experts from the two countries.
 
 My announcement ends here. Let me take your questions, if any.
 ………………………….
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, I had two questions. Both are about the fight against the PKK. First of all, there are some reports that some regulations made within the framework of EU reform efforts will be changed retrospectively within the scope of this struggle. I wonder if Turkey will take a step back from EU reforms in order to increase effectiveness in the fight against terrorism? This is my first question, and the second is between Northern Iraq and Turkey. What is the Foreign Office's view on this?
 
 ANSWER: Actually, my answer to both of your questions will be one. These are issues that are dealt with at the political level. But let me tell you, measures are taken to compromise neither our freedoms nor our security. No need to worry. We trust Turkey, Turkish democracy.
 
 QUESTION : Sir, today there was news in a newspaper headline that Greece gave a residence permit to one of the top executives of the terrorist organization PKK. Is there any information in the Foreign Office regarding this? Has an attempt been made in Greece?
 
 ANSWER: We have been expressing for a long time that we have much higher expectations from Europe regarding cooperation in the fight against terrorism. We expect much more, much more effective, much more concrete cooperation from the EU. Our Prime Minister has repeatedly expressed it. PKK terrorists are roaming in some EU countries. They are provided with accommodation and travel opportunities. This, I think, is part of the example you mentioned. As I said, we expect much more from the EU. We see the statements made. But we expect them to be more with us in the fight against terrorism.
 QUESTION: Well, Turkey knew about this event before, but did the Prime Minister make these statements about him? Or is this a development that you are just familiar with? Are there any initiatives in Greece?
 
 ANSWER: I wanted to reflect our point of view on the subject. I don't want to get into an individual discussion right now. But of course, when we look at it on the basis of individuals, you can put what I said under the same framework. Necessary actions will be taken. We've seen this latest news, too. Necessary evaluations will be made in our Ministry and related units.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, was there any contact with Iraq and the USA after the bill regarding the cross-border operation was accepted in the Turkish Grand National Assembly yesterday? A briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was given to the Ankara Ambassadors of the countries in the region, right after the memorandum was accepted for the first time last year. They were told why the motion was issued. Will there be a similar application this time? My second question was a suggestion of CHP Leader Deniz Baykal. Such as the revision and reorganization of the Turkey-Iraq border. Yesterday, the Chief of General Staff also pointed out that this is important and that such a study can be done. What is your opinion as a ministry? Is there any work you have done?
 
 ANSWER: Just like the only answer I gave to the two previous questions, I can give only one answer to this one. Immediately after the attack on Aktütün, a very heavy traffic started to be experienced in the upper levels of the state and this traffic continues today as you know. The suggestions made and the views put forward by the esteemed CHP leader and the MHP leader within this framework will undoubtedly be discussed in these environments. At the political level. If I have to say something different about the mandate, it is that following the attack on Aktütün, our foreign representations were instructed. Attempts were made in the capitals of the USA, EU, NATO, Arab League and international organizations. Our position, our sensitivities and the indignation we felt were expressed. Following this, a new attempt was made within the week and this time information was given about the bill in the relevant capitals. Like you said, Last year, when this bill was first issued, an information activity was held. At least at this initial stage, our interlocutors were informed about the purpose and objectives of the bill in a way that would not allow any misunderstanding. We will also inform you about the steps to be taken in the upcoming period.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, after this attack, discussions about hot pursuit in northern Iraq came to the fore again. Article 4 of the agreement signed with Iraq at the Prime Minister level last year could not be filled. The article on hot pursuit was left blank. What kind of work is being done in the ministry regarding the filling of this article and hot pursuit in the north of Iraq, are there any studies? What level of agreement can be reached in a short time?
 
 ANSWER: There are both the measures taken in the period following the Aktütün events and a process that has been going on since before. The legal dimension of this event. The legal dimension is progressing in its own way. But, of course, Turkey tries to do whatever it takes when it comes to any event or threat that threatens its security, and as you know, our Armed Forces has been taking the necessary precautions for the last few days.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, Turkey's Special Representative for Iraq, Murat Özçelik, had a number of contacts with regional government representatives in northern Iraq, within the scope of cooperation against terrorism originating from the north of Iraq. I wonder if there will be a meeting planned in this context in the coming period?
 ANSWER: By the way, our Special Representative for Iraq has been pretty busy lately, in the last few weeks. He went to Tehran in early September. He discussed the Iraq issue with the Iranian authorities in Tehran. Then he went to Baghdad. Last July, you will remember, a High Level Strategic Cooperation Council was formed during the visit of our Prime Minister to Iraq. He held talks in Baghdad about the projects envisaged to be implemented on the basis of this council. Then he went to England. He held talks in the UK about developments in Iraq and common areas of work. Then our Special Representative for Iraq went to Washington. He held talks in Washington with both the administration and the advisors of the two candidates on what can be done together in Iraq in the coming period and cooperation. In Northern Iraq, (IRÖT) Has our Special Representative in Iraq made any contact recently? No, as I recall, but we'll make that clear. No, as far as I remember.
 
 QUESTION : Sir, now, after these latest attacks, is it possible to review the Kurdish Administration in Northern Iraq, even if it is at a low level, regarding the ongoing contacts, this ongoing dialogue?
 
 ANSWER: We do not see the latest developments as a development that leads to antagonism between Turkey and Iraq, nor as a development that leads to ethnic antagonism. This is a matter of terrorism. In other words, it is not a Turkey-Iraq issue or an ethnic issue, but a terrorism issue. I will answer your question regarding Northern Iraq as follows. We, as Turkey, expect much more from Northern Iraq in the fight against terrorism. It is a grave situation for the PKK to carry out an attack using heavy weapons in Northern Iraq and to attempt to attack our border originating from Northern Iraq. We said this in our statement. The fact that this attack attempt was made with the support of heavy weapons in the north of Iraq, as I said, shows that the terrorist organization can continue its activities in this region.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak called Talabani Gul right after the attack and repeated his suggestion of the triple mechanism. But this was already a project that Turkey looked at coldly. In other words, while we were waiting for a different opening from Iraq, he replied with something that was suggested in the past but did not receive much support despite Turkey; How does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs evaluate this? Is this step enough?
 
 ANSWER: Immediately after the attack, I can say that Iraqi President Talabani called our President and condemned the attack and offered his condolences. In the aforementioned phone call, the President of Iraq reiterated his will to cooperate in the fight against the PKK. As for the triple mechanism proposal, such a mechanism, you know, was established before. Between Iraq-Turkey and the USA. We can only make an assessment now, when the details of the Iraqi side's proposal to revive such a tripartite committee become clear. In any case, if we are convinced that such a mechanism is productive, I think mobilization can be expected.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, you just mentioned it. During the Prime Minister's visit to Baghdad, it was decided to establish a high-level commission, I remember as a high-level advisory council. That is, for the exchange of ideas and for the implementation of events. First of all, after this attack with heavy weapons from Northern Iraq, has there been any contact between this council or high-level officials, has Turkey made any attempt to take a decision?
 
 ANSWER: Foreign policy is not carried out with sudden reactions. The intensive evaluation process I've been talking about these past few days addresses all these issues. Therefore, we must continue to pursue a foreign policy that will not favor terrorism. In other words, we have to adopt an attitude that looks after Turkey's long-term interests. There is no room for sentimentality in foreign policy. We need to be rational and patiently, rationally and continue to do what we think is right.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, did Mr. Babacan have a phone call with Zebari? If so, can you share with us what kind of messages were given? Or on the phone, did he have a conversation with any of his colleagues internationally, Rice or Europe.
 
 ANSWER: We had a very busy week indeed. That's why I'm not in a position to tell the exact details right now, but I can say this. He was with the Czech Prime Minister yesterday, Mr. Minister. He conveyed our position to him with strong expressions. The Czech Republic is an important country for us, but it also has another function: the Czech Republic is the EU's next term president. So, in that capacity, we addressed him. We told him our troubles, goals and position. Also, as far as I know, the Minister also met with Steinmeier yesterday afternoon. As you know, Germany is a country where we care for cooperation regarding PKK connections, and where we care for cooperation to destroy these connections. He also met Hosyar Zebari in New York, but I don't know if there was a meeting after that.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, the terrorist attacks continue. After Aktütün, there was an attack in Diyarbakır as well. I wonder if Turkey takes extra security measures for its foreign missions or diplomatic missions at home and abroad? Is there such an extra precaution? Both in terms of personnel and in terms of building security. Heading to a new security system?
 
 ANSWER: Unfortunately, Turkey, and in this context, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our Foreign Representatives have become accustomed to living with terrorism. I have held various positions in our Foreign Representations, so I know, in our Foreign Representations, precautions are always taken regarding the life and property safety of our members. According to the risk picture that our relevant authorities will create by contacting local authorities, these measures will be increased if necessary.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, Minister of Justice said that the comprehensive file on the Deniz Feneri case, which was decided a while ago in Germany, would be forwarded to the Turkish and Frankfurt Consulate General from the relevant state Ministry of Justice. I wonder if the Frankfurt Consulate General made the necessary application to request this comprehensive file from the German authorities?
 
 ANSWER: In accordance with the customary correspondence procedures in the field of legal assistance between Turkey and Germany, it has been announced that the legal aid documents on this matter were sent directly to our Frankfurt Consulate General by our Ministry of Justice. This is true. When this document is received by our Consulate General, it will be forwarded to the relevant German judicial authorities.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, to go back to the situation in Northern Iraq again. After the terrorist attack in Aktütün, Mr. Prime Minister clearly stated that Turkey could not get enough support from Northern Iraq, as you said, and then added that, if necessary, we will take measures that will bring results. What could be the measures to bring about this result? For example, if I am not mistaken, we supply electricity to the Kurdish Regional Government. In other words, could it be things like the power cut, or the trade route being shifted to Syria, as was done before? Could you give some information about this?
 
 ANSWER: I am sure that these questions you have asked will be on the agenda at the meeting to be held under the Presidency of the Prime Minister today. Therefore, it would be both misleading and wrong for me to make predictions about the possible results of the meeting before the meeting is held.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, maybe we went a little bit about Iraq, but I think we actually forgot about the process that started between Armenia and Turkey. After the bilateral and tripartite meetings held by the ministers in New York, at what level and when will the contacts for Armenia-Turkey relations continue. When do you expect the next meeting for the three-way meeting? After October 15?
 
 ANSWER: We haven't forgotten about this, don't worry. I can say something like this. A week or ten days have passed since the meeting of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey. I can't get it right now. He was 26, if I remember correctly, interview in New York. It was a historic meeting. The historic visit of our President to Yerevan was made in a short period of time following his historic visit to Yerevan with the issue of the national match. However, this happened in rapid succession due to the agenda of the UN General Assembly. Therefore, it should not be surprising if there are no meetings and developments at the same speed and at the same frequency. We said it back then, after the three-way meeting in New York. We would like to think that a new window of hope has opened. Both the problems between Turkey and Armenia,
 
 QUESTION: There was a recent request from Israel regarding the negotiations between Israel and Syria, mediated by Turkey. The adjournment had to do with the legal process for the appointment of the advisor. Can you convey the last point reached here? Normally, an approval was expected from Israel within a week and ten days, but this did not happen. I wonder if the information you have received is that the Attorney General's Office has reservations about granting such an authority, and therefore the process may be delayed a little, or will it continue without any problems?
 
 ANSWER: As you know, the mediated negotiations that started last May in line with the demands of Syria and Israel and as a result of Turkey's efforts failed at a time when the 5th round was expected to be held after 4 rounds. But it took on such an appearance not for a structural reason, but because of the internal developments in Israel. Our contacts with the parties continue for the 5th round of negotiations. More importantly, if we look at the issue from above, our opinion is that the parties have a sincere and constructive perspective on the negotiations. If we approach the issue in this way, we will avoid following the daily course of internal developments in Israel. Because this is something that the parties themselves will resolve when and where they see fit.
 
 QUESTION: Sir, it is very grave that this Aktütün attack, which you have just mentioned about terrorism, was carried out with heavy weapons, and in this context, is there any weakness in intelligence sharing with the USA? Does Turkey consider this intelligence sharing sufficient, what are your expectations from the USA?
 
 ANSWER: You will remember that Mr. Prime Minister visited Washington last November. The US administration had defined the PKK as a terrorist organization even before this visit. But after this visit, there was a clarification in the stance of the US administration. And an intelligence sharing began. Let me open a parenthesis here. The US defines the PKK not only as a terrorist organization but also as a drug smuggler. We understand that this has some consequences in terms of US law. Intelligence sharing continues. It continues over 24 hours.
 
 I think the American authorities confirmed this issue with their statements, either today or yesterday. At the center of our relations, I can say at least, is the fight against terrorism. After the Aktütün attack, attempts were made to ensure the border security, as I said. And these attempts were also made in Ankara. Let me say this from a slightly higher perspective. Our relations and cooperation are maintained as well today as before the attack. It would not be right to expect a fluctuation in relations by giving such instant reactions due to the attack, as I just said. These relations will continue to continue in a good way this week, as it was last week, and I hope in the coming period as well.
 
 QUESTION: How many chapters do you expect to be opened before the French Presidency ends?
 
 ANSWER: We express at every opportunity that we want to open as many chapters as possible and that there are chapters ready to be opened, not us, but the Commission. In that respect, I can count maybe a dozen chapters waiting to be opened. But, on the other hand, there is a phenomenon that we oppose. You know, we've said it over and over lately. It seems that a de facto situation has begun to emerge in the direction of opening two chapters in each term presidency. We do not consider this appropriate. We expect all chapters that are ready to be opened technically.
 
 Until today, the last two chapters were opened in June - Corporate Law and Intellectual Property Law. In this period, we will look at; We have an attempt to open as many chapters as possible.
 
 QUESTION: After the new process that started in Cyprus, the parties started to accuse each other that the process was progressing very slowly in a very early period. There are statements in this direction from both the north and the south. Is there any indication that the process is progressing so slowly in Ankara? If yes, what would you recommend to speed it up?
 
 ANSWER: Comprehensive negotiations started on 3 September. We welcomed this. We said that we hoped that the new process would bring a fair and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of UN parameters. In this process, we find that the Greek Cypriot side did not act with the speed we expected and hoped for, and we sadly observe that they make unfair accusations to the Turkish side. We think that such accusations targeting the Turkish side are against the philosophy and parameters of the UN comprehensive solution plan. The important thing now is this. If a window of opportunity has opened, we need to evaluate it. This process cannot last forever. So this should not be allowed to turn into an exercise in meetings.
 
 In this context, we support the constructive and somewhat locomotive attitude of the President of the TRNC, Mr. Talat. I repeat this question every time it comes up. The solution will and should be within the framework of two new partnership states, it should be based on the existence of two separate societies and two separate democracies within the framework of the principle of virgin birth. It should be bipartisan, politically equal and based on the equal status of the constituent states. It will be a solution in a framework where Turkey's effective and de facto guarantee will continue. We, as I said, are the principles involved in the process, and we will continue to support them.
 
 Thank you so much."

We are late. As I said before, we have a valid excuse. The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr. Muttaki, was a little late in his arrival at our Ministry. After the one-on-one meeting, which would take about an hour, it was decided to hold a press conference. Sorry we kept you waiting.
 
 
 
 This morning we had guests from two different regions. You know, one of them is from Kosovo, the President of Kosovo is visiting Ankara. Another delegation from the Western Thrace Turkish Minority visited the ministry. The President of Kosovo, Mr. Sejdiu, had meetings with our President, the Speaker of the Assembly and our Prime Minister. Minister Çavuşoğlu also met with him at a working breakfast this morning. We talked about our bilateral relations. We discussed both political, economic and cultural dimensions. In particular, TIKA's activities in Kosovo were discussed, and within this framework, we signed a protocol on the Status of Development Cooperation and TIKA Coordination Office. In other words, the status that our TIKA team will be subject to has become clear.
 
 
 
 As you know, yesterday there was the opening ceremony of a South East European Studies Application and Research Center established within Ankara University. The guest President gave a speech here. Minister Çavuşoğlu also made a speech. The visit of the President of Kosovo to our country is important in this respect; You will remember that Kosovo gained its independence in February 2008. It was the first Presidential visit from the country. It has a symbolic meaning for him. Turkey is one of the first countries to recognize the independence of Kosovo. I'm not sure if we're the first or the second, but we think we're the first to recognize it.
 
 
 
 Later, a delegation from the Western Thrace Turkish Minority had just been at the Ministry. The delegation informed us about the problems faced by the Turkish minority living in Greece in education, social, economic and other fields. He has some legitimate problems. There are some structural obstacles that our minority members face in their integration into Greek society. There was a discussion about it. They offered their appreciation and gratitude to us, Turkey, for standing by them in the struggle for rights and existence. We reiterated to them that we closely follow the problems of the Western Thrace Turkish Minority. Minorities - we always say there is a bridge analogy - we see minorities as bridges. Well, our compatriots can become productive Greek citizens. We see that Greece has started to realize this, and some steps will be taken in this direction in the future. We started to deal with this issue within the framework of a common understanding with Greece.
 
 
 
 After these announcements, I will start to take your questions, if any.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: The European Court of Human Rights made a decision yesterday that it is wrong to use the phrase ""religion"" on identity cards in Turkey. In this context, what kind of evaluation was made in the Ministry? After that, should we wait for a step towards abandoning the application?
 
 
 
 ANSWER: Now, this decision is new, it was taken yesterday. We will review. Similar decisions were taken by the ECHR in Europe before. I think about Greece, I may be wrong. Therefore, as far as we can see, there is a decision similar to ours in jurisprudence. But are there differences? So is there any difference between our case and previous cases? What steps should be taken? This issue will be evaluated by the lawyers of our Ministry in the upcoming period.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Burak, there are allegations that Turkey's Ambassador to Tel Aviv, Oguz Celikkol, may be assigned to another capital, a capital in Europe. Has there been any evaluation in this direction in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Did Mr. Celikkol make such a request?
 
 
 
 ANSWER: Let me say this very clearly; We talked to our Ambassador, he has no such request. There is no such plan in our ministry. Therefore, I can easily say to you that the news that has been published is unfounded at this stage.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Yesterday, the United States made a statement regarding Armenia. That the process should proceed independently of other developments. Here, there seems to be a reference to the Karabakh negotiations. Is the international community withdrawing its support for the Karabakh issue, which Turkey presents as a precondition in the background? We got such an impression, but what is your assessment?
 
 
 
 REPLY:Although Karabakh is a long-standing problem, there has been an acceleration in the recent period. Last week, the leaders met for the 9th time in Sochi. Russian Foreign Minister Mr. Lavrov made a statement after the meeting and said that the Madrid Principles document is being worked on, there are various positions on its preamble, and they are working on the rest. So what is the conclusion we draw from all this? We understand that there has been progress, albeit modest, in the negotiations between the parties. It seems that a glimmer of hope has emerged for taking concrete steps towards a solution in the coming period. Taking these concrete steps will naturally depend on the political will and courage of the parties. As you know, we are not the Minsk Group Co-Chair, but we are members.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Minister made a criticism about the visa application applied to Turkish citizens in EU countries. He declared that this was unfair. What steps has Turkey taken in this regard? Has there been an official application? Can you give us information about this topic?
 
 
 
 ANSWER: Turkey is a country that has been negotiating full membership for four years. So it's not just any country in Europe. A country whose institutional relations with the EU are getting stronger every day. Therefore, all kinds of difficulties our citizens face regarding visa issues really create an indignation for us. I would like to draw your attention to the following issue; we do not want visa convenience, we want visa exemption. Turkey must have passed the stage of convenience already.
 
 
 
 As you said, this issue was discussed in one of our most recent visits to Brussels. It was said that this event has some technical aspects. One is Readmission Agreement, one is biometric passports. Tell us what it takes, that is, tell us how the facilities brought to other countries such as Serbia and Macedonia emerged, let's complete this process, but when we complete it, we said that if there is still a problem, then we will accept it as a double standard. We are now working on the Readmission Agreement.
 
 
 
 For a long time, the EU was not very willing to share the burden of readmission. Now we see that there has been a movement recently and we will hold a round of negotiations on the readmission agreement in February.
 
 
 
 The issue of biometric passports took place in the press. It's something you know too. Our Ministry started a busy work with the Ministry of Interior and we set ourselves a target for biometric passports to be put into effect before the end of this year. This is always material issues, that is, tangible, tangible issues. What we want, a, b, c is put in front of us, we do our work in the same order as other countries were treated, and then our citizens are granted visa exemption.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: There was news today that Burak Bey had asked the Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi for help to improve relations with Turkey. How does Turkey view this? What role can the Italian Prime Minister play in improving relations between the two countries?
 
 
 
 ANSWER: Now, let's not get into the discussion of whether our relations have deteriorated or not. But there are criticisms that we have directed towards Israel. You all know that this is based on very concrete reasons: Gaza. When the Gaza incident occurred, a new picture emerged. A new picture has emerged in the Middle East. Peace processes, channels blocked. We all know the drama that the people of Gaza experience there. This situation needs to improve. There is no need for others to intervene, we are already meeting. But if a friend like Italy can convince the Israeli side to revert from its mistakes, we will not object to that.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: My question will be about Armenia. After the reasoned decision of the Armenian Constitutional Court, Mr. Sinirlioğlu had a plan to go first to Switzerland and then to the United States. There are reports that he will leave tomorrow, is it true? And what exactly do we expect from the talks there? Thanks.
 
 
 
 ANSWER: We expressed our views on the new situation that emerged after the reasoned decision of the Armenian Constitutional Court was published, on that very day, on January 18, even at a late hour. In this statement, we said that we, as Turkey, adhere to both the spirit of the protocols when they are being negotiated and the wording of the resulting text. We expect the same from the other side. We expect them to show the political will that we have shown. In other words, the negotiations, after all, the negotiations took two years. Both sides know very well what the other side is thinking.
 
 
 
 Immediately after this court decision, the Armenian side embarked on a campaign. So it's as if Turkey has changed its mind. No, Turkey did not change its mind. Our stand is fixed. If you look out the window of a train at the station, you might think for a moment that the train is moving. But maybe it's the train next door that moves. This is an oversight. This is what is being created now; we stand where we stand, the other train moving.
 
 
 
 Yes, in the coming days, our Undersecretary will make a short-term visit to both Switzerland and the United States, and will convey our concerns to the other party in detail. In fact, the Minister directly conveyed our concerns during his meetings with his Armenian colleague.
 
 
 
 In other words, there is no problem in Turkey's Armenian opening. In fact, it is Armenia's opening to Turkey, which fell into trouble with the decision. We all need to understand this very well.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: I want to ask Mr. Burak about Iraq. According to some news today, Member of the Iraqi Parliament Bayazit Hasan stated that they gave notes to Turkey 8 times in 4 months and showed that Turkey violated the borders of the Kurdish Region 57 times as the reason for this. Can we get any information about it?
 
 
 
 ANSWER: I don't know how many times who gave notes. However, if Turkey has taken an action, it is because of terrorism. In other words, it is a response to terrorism. Our position is very clear. Despite the increasing cooperation of the Iraqi authorities - various mechanisms have been established and some progress has been made - we know that terrorist centers are still active there. If Turkey has taken an action, it is completely in line with international law. It will continue to protect its citizens on the basis of life and property. But I would like to think that we are entering a new era. In other words, instead of communicating with such notes, we all saw that we entered a new era with Iraq. The number of agreements signed during the Prime Minister's visit to Baghdad in October is probably more than the number of notes you mentioned.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: The revision of Turkey's National Security Policy Document will be on the agenda this year. Is there any work carried out in the Ministry regarding the external threats here? And within the framework of the ""zero problems with neighbors policy"", will this be reflected in this document from now on?
 
 
 
 ANSWER: Will the National Security Policy Document change or not? What is inside? This, of course, is something that the political authorities will know, a work to be carried out under their instruction. But there has already been talk about Armenia, we have expressed our views on the subject. What's left? Greece remained. Since we are talking about Iraq. Greece; now there's a spyalways complained about his decision. This is not a decision. This is a statement made by the TGNA in 1995. This statement was not made out of nowhere. When the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force in 1994, the Greek Parliament granted its Government the right to extend the Greek territorial waters to 12 miles when it deems appropriate, which includes the provision of extending the territorial seas up to 12 miles in the Convention. The statement made by the TGNA was also made after this decision. I mean, it wasn't done out of nowhere, that's what I'm saying. In fact, there is no such threatening expression in the text of the statement. I mean, cause of war etc. does not say. Open it up, it doesn't call our '95 statement a reason for war. It is just a statement that since you have made such a decision, you can be sure that we will protect our rights and interests, as we are here . Casus BelliIt may have been perceived as such, but I repeat, it has a reason. Therefore, if these reasons are eliminated, we can continue on our way quite comfortably.
 
 
 
 Then let's stay here for a while if you want, because I guess the Ministers will come here in half an hour, we will continue where we left off.
 
 Thanks."

Today, it has been seen that some other media organs have published the news in question.
 
 It is a pity that a material error in the news was not corrected upon warning."

 Turkey welcomes the right decision of The Danish Government to file suit against PKK broadcasting organizations which is also in line with their international responsibilities on combating terrorism.
 
 We expect these broadcasting organizations, which support terrorism and promote violence, to be punished accordingly."

 If you'll excuse me, I'd like to start today's press conference with three topics. The first is the visit of our Minister to the People's Republic of China, which will start today, the second is the EXPO Fair, which we will attend there, and the third is the RECCA meeting, which will be held in Istanbul right after. Then, if you want, we can move on to the questions.
 
 As you know, our Minister's visit to the People's Republic of China, which will start today, and some of you will be with us, covers five cities; Kashgar, Urumqi, Xian then Shanghai and Beijing. In his contacts here and in these cities, our Minister will hold talks with the notables of the province as well as the official authorities.
 
 I said EXPO is the second topic. As you know, the EXPO fair is held in Shanghai and will be closed on October 31st. Here, Turkey is also represented with an exhibition. The theme of our exhibition; Turkey, ""Cradle of Civilizations""; Anadolu, “Better Cities, Better Lives Space”; Istanbul, “Two Continents, One City”. We see that our exhibition area here has attracted great interest so far. As of yesterday, more than seventy million people visited EXPO, and our exhibition was also visited by more than seven million people as of yesterday. Therefore, one out of every ten people visiting the EXPO fair, and even more, has also visited our fair and exhibition area.
 
 The third is the RECCA meeting, which will be held in Istanbul on his return from the PRC. Let me repeat the definition of RECCA; 'Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan'. This meeting, organized by Turkey together with Afghanistan, will be held on 2-3 November 2010 in Istanbul, hosted by our country. The meeting will focus on Afghanistan's economic development. In addition, a Business Forum with the participation of one hundred private sector representatives, as well as an Academic Forum with the participation of about fifty academics on the development of regional cooperation will be held. I want to cut it right away with this short introduction. I'm guessing there are questions.
 
 QUESTION: Which other countries will participate in RECCA?
 
 REPLY:All neighbors of Afghanistan and the countries of the region were invited to RECCA. Most participate at varying levels; All neighbors of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, as well as EU members, but their participation levels have not been finalized yet, so there are countries that are not clear.
 
 QUESTION: What is the level?
 
 ANSWER: Let me take the questions collectively, or shall we start with RECCA? Its level is normally at Ministerial level. Minister Çavuşoğlu will also attend as of his current schedule.
 
 QUESTION:Mr. Selçuk, there were news in the Greek media that important steps were taken towards a solution in the Aegean, and that a consensus was reached to a large extent. Now, first of all, these news, there are details, naturally, in these news, first of all, are these news true? Secondly, if there is such an agreement, is it a result of exploratory talks or is it an individual initiative of the Prime Minister? Third, if there is such a consensus, why do we learn about it from the Greek press?
 
 ANSWER: I'll take a round of questions if you want, and then I'll answer them collectively.
 
 QUESTION:Talks with the United States on the missile shield had begun in the past weeks. Are the negotiations still going on? It seems that the NATO Summit will again be focused on this issue. Which red lines will Turkey go with and which ones are indispensable in this regard?
 
 QUESTION: Turkey was sentenced by the ECHR to a record-breaking amount of compensation for the compensation filed by the Greeks in 19 separate cases. Prior to this, the Minister had statements that Turkey would take a series of measures in the relevant Ministries to prevent cases before the ECtHR. Will work on this begin now? Because the amount is too high. What will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do?
 
 QUESTION:Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the unit that raided the Mavi Marmara, and according to the news we read yesterday, he praised the heroism of this unit with very strong expressions. Is there a reaction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this issue?
 
 QUESTION: I would like to ask the rest of my friend's question. In the same context, is there any development in Turkey-Israel relations, what is the latest level of relations in Turkey-Israel relations? There was also a news yesterday in both the national and foreign press that the relations or cooperation between Mossad and MIT were frozen. Does Turkey have such a decision?
 
 QUESTION:It's actually about the same issue. Some new news appeared in the press about the raid. There are reports that the ship is actually going to Egypt and that Israel has been informed about this, but at the last moment, it seems as if things got out of control with the raid and could not go to Egypt as planned. Do you have any confirmation on this or can you give more details?
 
 QUESTION: I would like to ask about Nechirvan Barzani's visit yesterday. First, how much terrorism was involved, or was the agenda mostly the efforts to form a government in Iraq? We also more or less know the attitudes of the Kurds towards forming this government. Therefore, after listening to them to the establishment of the government, can you draw a picture of how close a government can be formed in Iraq right now?
 
 QUESTION:I would like to ask in addition to Deniz's question. The title of Nechirvan Barzani was listed on the Prime Ministry website as 'Leader of the Iraqi Kurdistan National Administration' yesterday. Is there a difference in the definition, or has Turkey changed its policy?
 
 QUESTION: There is some news in the American press about this missile shield system. It is stated that Turkey has set a precondition such as not sharing the intelligence to be obtained with Israel and that negotiations are being held on this issue, and that the United States is warmly attracted to this condition. Is it true, is there such a reservation?
 
 QUESTION:It is written about this, that it is said that Washington has accepted Turkey's demands both not to give data to Israel and not to mention Iran's name. Also, regarding Israel, a second letter from the commission investigating the Mavi Marmara raid in Israel was sent to the Tel Aviv Embassy. The Israeli side stated that it wanted to take statements from all the crew and passengers. Has this request been examined in Ankara, has a conclusion been reached?
 
 ANSWER: I will try to answer by summing up.
 
 First of all, let me start with the question about the Aegean. As you know, exploratory talks started in 2002. It has been going on regularly since 2002. These are referred to as 'exploratory talks' and the parties are talking about every issue that concerns the two countries in this area. In principle, we do not give any information about the content of the talks. The reason for this is that the interview is at an exploratory level. Therefore, we are not in a position to confirm, confirm or deny the information in the question you asked or the information in the Greek press, because if we confirm or deny them, firstly, we would violate the principle of informing about the content of the conversation, and secondly, we would undermine the silence decision between the parties about the content of the conversation.
 
 QUESTION: Excuse me, do we understand then that this is related to exploration? So we understand that there is no separate initiative here, right?
 
 ANSWER: Yes, of course, it is also mentioned in the news there, that is, in the news in the Greek press. Therefore, exploratory talks continue. The parties, namely Turkey and Greece, continue their negotiations with a positive understanding of cooperation. There is also the political will to continue these talks.
 
 QUESTION:In addition, I will ask, you said it was written separately, you said it as if you were in exploratory talks together, not separately. However, there were some statements in Greek newspapers, such as the suggestion that it should be handled as a separate process, and even the Greeks' follow-up, 'this is against the sovereign right, it constitutes a violation.
 
 ANSWER: No, exploratory talks are continuing, so there is no frozen process, we also have the political will on this issue. I think you want to say something additional…
 
 QUESTION: So, I understand that exploratory talks are also carried out in the Greek press, this was a separate initiative where the Prime Minister spoke with Papandreou, although it was related, it was reflected as a separate initiative.
 
 ANSWER: Political leaders in every meeting, namely Turkish and Greek political leaders, of course refer to exploratory talks. They reiterate their agreement on the continuation of these talks. That's what happened on the last visit. Maybe it was reflected in the Greek press differently, but exploratory talks continue.
 
 I want to move on to the question about the missile shield. We have shared with the public more or less, before, even in detail, our main position in the missile defense system talks. Here we are in favor of NATO developing this issue within an inclusive system that will increase the security of the entire Alliance and all Allies. Contacts and negotiations on this issue are also ongoing. We set out from the principle of indivisibility of security. No decision has been taken. Our contacts and negotiations continue with all relevant parties. I would like to answer the issue of some news in the American or Israeli press in the same way. The important thing here is that the negotiations continue. No conclusion has been reached at this stage in the negotiations. These contacts will continue.
 
 19 lawsuits and the amount to be paid, you know. After the TMK was established, as per the 2005 Xenedis/Arestis decision, with a decision of the ECtHR dated 5 March 2010, it was confirmed that this system is an effective and accessible domestic remedy. With the TMK being effective, the way for the citizens of the Greek Cypriot Administration to apply here has been opened. Therefore, this order was a functioning legal order and its existence was repeated once again. Many applications have been made so far, most of them have been finalized.
 
 The applications subject to your question are those that were found acceptable by the ECtHR before the TMK became effective and that were decided in violation within the framework of the first article of the Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. Therefore, it does not mean a negative result regarding the effectiveness of the TMK. As you probably know, Greek citizens have to apply to the TMK for their property claims or to wait for the result of a comprehensive solution to be reached in Cyprus, on the island, after the decision of March 5, 2010, in which the effectiveness of the TMK was recognized.
 
 Netanyahu's visit to this union and Turkey-Israel relations, I would like to summarize them and respond. You know, our views on this subject have been expressed most clearly from the very beginning. You know our expectations from Israel. There is nothing to add to these.
 
 A friend of ours asked about the level of cooperation between intelligence agencies. You know, we never comment on intelligence matters.
 
 Apart from this, of course, the issue of combating terrorism was discussed during Nechirvan Barzani's visit. Our agreement on the continuation of our contacts and dialogue in the fight against terrorism was confirmed, but the main talks were mainly about the process of forming a government in Iraq. If you ask what was discussed here, the messages we gave were as follows: With the establishment of the government in a short time, the steps towards the welfare and peace of Iraq will continue, or if the government cannot be formed, the current uncertainty will continue. Of course, we work for the peace, tranquility and stability of Iraq, and we hope for this. For this reason, we want the government to be formed as soon as possible. We wish the government to be an inclusive government. We repeated these messages. I mentioned the dimension of the fight against terrorism. Likewise, economic and commercial cooperation issues were discussed. We already have a strong presence here in the region. They wanted this to continue. We said that we will continue our current work for the economic development of the region.
 
 What you're asking is about the adjective. Talked to the Prime Ministry in the morning, so according to the information received from the Prime Ministry, this was done accidentally, there is no change in our attitude.
 
 QUESTION: That wasn't my question, it's about the Mavi Marmara...
 
 ANSWER: If you mean a news item in the press recently, we're not in a position to deny it, but we're not giving any more details, because we've prepared our report on this subject. As you know, we gave it to the commission established by the UN Secretary General on September 1, upon our request. Work on this is also ongoing. We are waiting for the commission to return to us. Likewise, I guess that Israel will give its report to this commission, but we do not have any information yet that it has submitted its report.
 
 QUESTION:You said inadvertently, but what exactly do you mean by mistake?
 
 ANSWER: In other words, it was accidental.
 
 QUESTION: Did they translate it wrong?
 
 ANSWER: Friends, we are sharing it with you according to the information we received from the Prime Ministry in the morning.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Selçuk, we heard that this Tripartite Mechanism meeting is planned to be held at the end of this month, but is there a date set?
 
 ANSWER: The last time you know, a technical committee meeting was held in October, but as far as I know, a precise date has not been determined. Our work on this issue continues.
 
 QUESTION:I guess there was the old system, so I think it is much more efficient to take the questions separately. Some things are not well understood. For example, we may have some doubts about exactly what you are responding to.
 
 QUESTION: In addition to the question, you said that the negotiations are continuing, but in principle it is about this sharing, I guess, intelligence sharing etc. We probably do not want this during these negotiations, right? What is our principled stance?
 
 ANSWER: What we want is to put this in a certain framework and to see what everyone's perception of threat is. After that, we need to see ahead. After that, only some decisions can be made. No decision has been taken. Therefore, as I said, contacts and negotiations continue.
 
 You're right about the questions being answered, but we have a very tight schedule today. Therefore, we had to choose this method.
 
 Thanks friends."

 Welcome to our regular weekly press conference. Today, we have our guests from Egypt, who are members of the press. I would also like to welcome our journalist friends and brothers from Egypt. I greet them too. Egyptian journalist friends who are in contact in Ankara and Istanbul will also watch our meeting. Our talks with them will continue today. Welcome back.
 
 
 
 I would like to start our meeting by conveying a few points. Then we can move on to your questions, if any. First, we've announced it before. We had 4 citizens who were kidnapped in Afghanistan before. As of today, these citizens have returned to our country safely. Once again, we wish them and their families well. We would also like to thank all parties involved in the release process, be it NATO authorities or other circles.
 
 
 
 I would like to make a statement regarding the upcoming period. Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio de Aguiar Patriota will pay a visit to our country on 11-12 September upon the invitation of our Minister. Within the framework of this visit, it will also be accepted by our President. On the occasion of the visit, the third meeting of the high-level cooperation commission, which was established between the foreign ministers of the two countries in 2006 and which was held for the second time during our Minister's visit to Brazil in April 2010, will come together in Istanbul. During the meetings, the relations between Turkey and Brazil, which have recently moved to a strategic level, as well as international and regional issues of interest to both countries will be discussed. This visit was attended by the Brazilian Foreign Minister,
 
 
 
 Apart from this, of course, our diplomatic contacts continue. Upon the calls of our Minister, there was a phone call with the Jordanian and German Foreign Ministers. In these phone calls, a general consultation was held with the Jordanian Foreign Minister on issues concerning the Middle East before the Arab League meeting. A general exchange of views was held with the German Foreign Minister on issues concerning the developments in the Middle East. I will stop after this brief explanation. If there are any, I would like to move on to the questions.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Sevil Küçükkosum. Hurriyet Daily Nevs Newspaper. I want to ask three questions. First of all, after the clear decision to install the radar part of the missile defense system planned under the umbrella of NATO in Turkey, or at least your statements in this direction, after Turkey's revealing its intentions, increasingly critical statements are coming from Iran. Has there been any recent contact with Iran regarding this issue? I would like to ask him to discuss this matter. My second question is, there are reports in the press today that Nechirvan Barzani from Iraq wants to make a visit to Turkey next week. Is there such a visit request and has the date been clarified? My third question is Prime Minister Erdogan's statement in the interview he gave to Al Jazeera Television. Israel has a comment that it cannot unilaterally use the natural resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. In what context do you evaluate this? Could you clarify this a little? Thank you.
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: First of all, let me start with your first question. As you know, the new concept, the new strategic concept, was made for the alliance to respond to the security challenges of the 21st century. Based on its defense capabilities, it aims to strengthen NATO's deterrence. In this context, many countries have work to be done in this new system. In this context, we stated that the radar system will be deployed in our country. I would like to repeat once again that this system is not against any country, but is for the defense of the NATO area and is a defense system. The system envisaged to be established in Turkey is only a radar system. If it comes to your second question, I read the news that Nechirvan Barzani will come to our country. I don't have any official information about this yet. However, naturally, our contacts with both the Iraqi authorities and the regional authorities continue.
 
 
 
 As a matter of fact, the Undersecretary of our Ministry, Ambassador Feridun Sinirlioğlu, will go to Baghdad tomorrow for official consultations with Iraq. It is envisaged that he will travel from Baghdad to Erbil later on. In these contacts, of course, our relations with Iraq will be discussed in every sense. Naturally, the issue of combating terrorism will also come to the fore during these meetings.
 
 
 
 You asked for the statement of our Prime Minister. Necessary explanations were made on this subject, especially by our Prime Minister. I have nothing to add to this.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: One of the elements in the statements of the Prime Minister is that the navy of warships, namely Turkish warships, will accompany our ships, that is, Turkish ships. So, is it necessary to remove this from here? I wonder if the Turkish navy will accompany these ships while human rights organizations send aid to Gaza in the future, thank you.
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: I just gave the answer to this question. In this regard, statements were made, especially by our Honorable Prime Minister. I have nothing to add to this at this time.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Selçuk, there are reports that the regional Kurdish administration in Northern Iraq wants Turkey not to carry out an operation until October, across the border, is it true? It is also stated that the Minister of Interior of the Kurdish administration, Kerim Sincari, made a secret visit to Ankara in the past few days. Did such a visit take place? Thanks.
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: We already have contacts with the regional authorities on many issues, including cooperation in the fight against terrorism, and these will continue. However, I don't have any official information about the two issues you mentioned at the moment.
 
 
 
 QUESTION : Buket Güven Turkish newspaper. My question will be about Israel. Is Turkey considering closing its airspace to Israeli military aircraft? Previously, it was on the agenda not to allow a plane to Poland. Was there a second case like this, or a situation where permission was not given that we do not know about? Can you share with us? Also, within the framework of UN meetings, is any meeting with Israel planned, even if it is on the go? Thank you.
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: Our latest measures announced by our Honorable Minister are already very clear. There were also measures taken before that. Military flights were already among them. There is no other new measure taken. The old measures remain the same. I can't remember exactly what you're talking about. Frankly, I need to look into the issue of permission for the plane to Poland. There are no scheduled meetings at the UN at this time.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Selçuk, I have two questions. Fulya Ozerkan, AFP. My first question is, in your last statement regarding the deployment of these early warning radar systems in Turkey, you said that the technical negotiations have come to an end. Are there any details about this? In which provinces is it planned to be deployed? Any info on who will be in command? And there was a lot of criticism about the timing of this statement. That it was made on the evening of the day the UN report leaked. What do you say to the critics about this? Also, Erdogan's turning his Egypt visit into an Arab tour came to the fore. Libya and Tunisia will be added to this tour. Has his trip to Gaza fallen off the agenda?
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: First of all, this defense system, which is envisaged to have a radar dimension in Turkey, will have an element in many countries. We announced that a radar element will be deployed in Turkey. As you can appreciate about the place of this, at this stage, we are not in a position to give any information or explanation to the public. Studies on this subject are ongoing and will continue to do so. Various news appeared in the newspapers on this subject. However, there is currently no place name that we can officially say. As for his command, we've said it before. There is a common command and control system here. Since it is a defense system established within the framework of NATO, naturally, Turkey will also take part in this command and control system. I disagree with the criticisms about timing. Discussions on this issue were ongoing. It is a coincidence that it coincided with the day of the statement about Israel.
 
 
 
 On the Gaza issue, we are at the point of our Prime Minister's statement on this issue. He has already made a very clear statement about it.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Can you give information about Selcuk Bey's Baghdad contacts? Will there be any contact with the Kurdish administration? Out of town? And what will Turkey's message be to the Baghdad administration? To the central Iraqi government.
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: First of all, I would like to say this. The departure of our Honorable Undersecretary to Baghdad is made within the framework of regular consultations with Iraqi authorities, regular consultations between foreign ministries. In this sense, our bilateral relations with Iraq, regional issues and of course the fight against terrorism will also be on the agenda. From here, I said that our Undersecretary would go to Erbil and hold contacts there. There, too, the issue of combating terrorism and cooperation in the fight against terrorism will naturally be on the agenda.
 
 
 
 QUESTION : Özden Sanberk says in an interview with a newspaper today that Gaza is now considered a national issue just like Cyprus for Turkey. Would it be correct to interpret this as a foreign policy?
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: Let me put it this way, as you said, Ambassador Özdem Sanberk is a retired esteemed member of our Ministry and is our former undersecretary. I understand that his statement is in this context. But he was the member Turkey gave to the Palmer Commission. If we are talking about the same newspaper, I guess you mean that statement. He pointed out the importance of a political issue within the framework of his own memories there. Naturally, the Palestine issue, and in this context, the Gaza issue is an issue that Turkey follows very closely and attaches great importance to. We probably don't need to repeat this.
 
 
 
 QUESTION : Zeynep Şafak Hürriyet newspaper. Selçuk Bey, on September 5, another bomb attack occurred in Afghanistan and 8 people died. It is said that a Turkish engineer was among the dead. Is there any information about his identity or information that has reached you?
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: We have information on this issue that one of our citizens was injured and died as a result of a mine explosion. However, you can appreciate that we never reveal his identity publicly before sharing it with his family and before establishing the necessary contact with his family. So their names. However, our Embassy has been in close contact with both NATO authorities, Afghan authorities and relevant company officials from the day this incident took place. We are still working on bringing the body.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Selcuk, I had another question about Iraq. Zeynep Tugrul. Star newspaper. The subject of hot pursuit was left blank in the agreement, which determined the extent of the relations signed between Turkey and the Iraqi government, which was established with the first democratic elections after Saddam. That item would be filled later. You know that in the fight against this PKK, Iraq gave a note to Turkey in the past few weeks. I wonder if Turkey will submit a request for the subject of hot pursuit to be formally included in the framework of this agreement during the visit of Mr. Sinirlioğlu?
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: I just said that during these contacts and visits, the fight against terrorism will naturally be discussed in a broad way. However, it is not possible to go into the details of these at the moment.
 
 
 
 QUESTION : Bulent Kaya. Channel 7 It is stated that the Prime Minister can make a speech in Tahrir Square as part of his visit to Egypt. Any information on this? Is there any preparation for this? It is also stated that an agreement will be made with Egypt on a joint exercise point in the Eastern Mediterranean. Is this information correct?
 
 
 
 SELÇUK ÜNAL: Preparations for our Prime Minister's visit to Egypt are continuing. A consultation program with the Egyptian authorities on this issue is still being worked on. Therefore, which agreements will be signed in the upcoming period and which issues will be discussed are issues that have not yet been finalized, although these are generally clear. However, when the program of our Prime Minister is clarified or the agreement to be signed becomes clear, these will be shared with the public. There are no more questions. Thank you friends."

 We are deeply saddened by the death of Meshal Tammo, the Leader of the Future Kurdish Movement in Syria, as a result of a heinous assassination on 7 October, and the injury of one of the leading opposition figures, Riyad Seif, in an attack targeting him.
 May God have mercy on Tammo who lost his life, patience for his grieving family and relatives; We wish a speedy recovery to Seif, who was injured and taken to the hospital.
 We are deeply concerned and strongly condemn the attempts to suppress the Syrian opposition and the increase in attacks targeting prominent opposition representatives.
 A pluralistic, democratic society can only be achieved with polyphony. Turkey expects the Syrian Administration to realize as soon as possible that the use of violence to suppress the Syrian opposition, which tries to express its views through peaceful means, cannot reverse the course of history."

 MINISTER: Distinguished members of the press. Today, we welcome our dear friend, Hosyar Zebari, the Foreign Minister of Iraq, who knows Ankara very well, who has stayed in Ankara for a long time, like an Ankara native. This is an important visit both in terms of the friendship ties between the two countries and in terms of its timing. While there is a great transformation process going on in our region, there is nothing more natural than to be in intense contact with the two democratic countries of the region, Turkey and Iraq, where free elections are dominant, on these developments and bilateral relations in the region. We had extensive talks yesterday and today. In fact, we covered regional issues comprehensively last night. Today, we discussed bilateral issues. Also, already two days ago, representing all Ministries from Iraq, A delegation of eleven people came to represent the ministries and institutions. The preparations were reviewed, especially in the context of the High Level Strategy Cooperation Council, under the co-chairmanship of our Undersecretary and the Undersecretary of the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, when we came together as the two Foreign Ministers, many issues had already been discussed and very serious distances had been covered. Last night, we focused more on regional issues. We shared our views mutually, especially around the importance of Turkey and Iraq looking at the latest changes in our region from the same perspective. In fact, when the events first started in Tunisia in December last year, I was in Iraq on the same day. And to my dear friend Hoşyar Bey, I also expressed to Mr. Maliki that the success of democracy in Iraq will inspire the region and that a brand new atmosphere will be created in the region with this success. Since then, there has been a great increase in democratic demands in the region. The demands of the peoples for the rule of law, human rights and democratic rights gained great momentum. And Iraq, as the first country in the Arab world to hold free elections in a very participatory way during this period, Lebanon of course has previous experience and has a pioneering role in this regard. Turkey and Iraq, we have the same perspective on the spread of these democratic values ​​that we have adopted in the region and the realization of the just demands of the peoples. Therefore, there is a great parallelism in our view of the developments in the region. We discussed dual issues. Hopefully, by the end of this year, we will gather the High Level Strategic Cooperation Council in Turkey as soon as possible, possibly in November. We are trying to match the dates of our prime ministers. We already held the first High Level Strategic Cooperation Council with Iraq and signed 48 agreements. In this High Level Strategic Cooperation Council, we will undertake many important projects that cover all fields from transportation to health, from agriculture to energy and that will bring Iraq and Turkey together even more. Our delegations held very successful meetings in 11 subcommittees. Today, as two ministers, we reviewed these studies together with my dear friend.

 Of course, there are some issues that stand out in the context of this High Level Strategic Cooperation Council and beyond. Of course, terrorism comes first. Today, we devoted a significant part of our morning work to terrorism-related issues. Because the threat to Turkey arising from the terrorist organization focused on Iraq poses a threat to both Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and Turkey's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We have to take a clear position against it. Turkey is determined to end this terrorist activity. The statement made by Honorable Prime Minister Nuri El Maliki 2 days ago also includes a very correct approach. We have expressed our appreciation in this regard. Indeed, if Iraq achieves full military control of its own territory, this is important both in terms of Iraq's capacity to control its own territory, in terms of its sovereignty, and in the prevention of terrorist activities against Turkey. In such a situation, of course, Turkey will not feel the need for any cross-border operation, there is nothing more natural than that. On the contrary, we have always defended and will continue to defend Iraq's territorial integrity and national sovereignty. The PKK is first and foremost a threat to Iraq. And the measure we will take against the PKK is neither against Iraq nor against any ethnic group in Iraq. We consider the whole of Iraq as brothers. But I expressed it very clearly to my dear friend. To Mr. Talabani of our President, as we have always expressed, expressed at all levels, The point that our esteemed Prime Minister expressed to Mr. Nuri al-Maliki in the whole meeting is that we can no longer tolerate a terrorist activity on Iraqi soil that poses a threat to Turkey, this should be known. We have developed strong mechanisms in this regard, and we have had bilateral consultations. But still, this terrorist threat continues towards Turkey. We are determined to take the most effective measures in this regard. And we are grateful for the understanding that the Iraqi authorities have shown us in this matter. We have a common perspective on this issue. No one in the world supports terrorism. Especially the stance of a friendly and neighboring country like Iraq on this issue is very clear. I also thanked him for his understanding in this matter. From now on, our joint work on terrorism at all levels will continue. We can no longer tolerate a terrorist activity on Iraqi soil that poses a threat to Turkey, this should be known.

 Again, we discussed the issue of opening new border gates, among other important issues. This is of great importance in the context of increasing and intensifying trade between Turkey and Iraq. With the new border gates, Turkey and Iraq, the Turkish people and the Iraqi people will become more interlocked and enter into intertwined relations with each other. Again, the water issue is an area of ​​cooperation for us. It is a space of cooperation, not an area of ​​conflict or different tensions. We think that there is a great potential for cooperation with neighboring countries on an issue such as water, which is a blessing. We will give all kinds of support to Iraq in the future, especially in terms of water management, prevention of water waste and studies to be carried out in this regard. We have always been sensitive to this need of Iraq, our neighborhood law also requires it. We have tripartite mechanisms in this regard, between Turkey-Iraq-Syria. We are determined to further develop this area of ​​cooperation by operating all mechanisms and realizing reforms related to inland water management in Iraq. In addition, there are great cooperation potentials in the field of energy, transportation, health and agriculture. Both our delegations discussed and we reviewed them. Hopefully, at the High Level Strategic Cooperation Council Meeting in the coming period, the model brotherhood law between Turkey and Iraq will go further and an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation will be created that will set an example for our region.

 I would like to welcome my dear friend Hoşyar again.
 
 
 
 
 IRAQ FOREIGN MINISTER HOŞYAR ZEBARİ- First of all, I really want to visit Turkey and have the opportunity to meet with my friend and dear brother Ahmet Davutoğlu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, as well as His Excellency the President and hopefully also the Prime Minister. I am very happy about that. This visit actually coincides with such a period that, as it is known, the Middle East region and the Arab world see great changes and revolutionary developments in this region. And of course we need consultations. At the political level, we are neighbors, but also as a friend, brother, and Iraq takes its own decisions and makes its own decisions in the interest of the country. we are here, We are here within the framework of organizing meetings at the level of technical delegations. We are within the framework of the High Level Strategic Cooperation Council that we signed earlier, which we signed in 2009, which was signed in 1900, and so far if we review it easily, we will see that whether it is in the commercial, economic, political, cultural level. Great strides have been made between the two countries. Maybe not at the desired level. But at the same time we have accomplished many aims, many aims of this Strategy Council. This time also very positive results were achieved. First of all, a new gateway will be opened and a third bridge will be created for the purpose of developing trade. At the same time, bilateral talks were held on the water issue. The esteemed Turkish leader also emphasized this. Because this is a divine right and there is no doubt that we need water to a large extent, and our brothers in the technical committee have stated that they are ready to discuss this issue, and that they are ready to discuss it on a technical level. And he expressed his feelings for this issue to be resolved as well. We offer our endless thanks for this opportunity and our endless thanks for the benefits. At the same time, Turkey's hospitals and Turkish planes and Turkish doctors have always been present, from the north to the south, in humanitarian aid to the victims of terrorism, to the wounded, in which Turkey has always played a leading role, all over Iraq. And indeed these were very human initiatives and good initiatives. Even yesterday, as it is known, he witnessed a terrorist act again in Iraq, he witnessed suicide acts. Therefore, our attitude towards terrorism and terrorists is stable and a principled one. And when it comes to PKK elements and PKK groups, their presence in the mountainous and rural areas of Iraq is illegal and unacceptable according to the Iraqi Constitution, and no government can accept this. And the statement given by our Prime Minister Maliki, which expressed that the government is responsible. And there is no doubt that it is the leading role of any government that any government should respect itself, to exercise its administration and control over all the regions.

 Second point; there is only the existence of the PKK and elements of some other organizations. It has PJAK, the organization of the people's mujahideen, all their responsibilities are the responsibility of the Iraqi Government. And all these entities, whether armed or terrorist, are unacceptable and it is the government's duty to end this situation. We are not in any conflict regarding this matter. I would like to emphasize this: My dear brother, my friend, my dear dear friend, I want to emphasize that: We are in agreement on this issue. There is no disagreement, therefore, regarding the respect of the territorial integrity of the two countries and the real termination of this illegitimate and unacceptable existence within the framework of positive and constructive cooperation at the bilateral level. I would like to clearly emphasize that: Perhaps we will follow methods and mechanisms regarding this issue. And we act as a government. Whether in Baghdad or in Turkey as the Prime Minister said, it reflects the Government's view. It is not possible for me to cite a different opinion. We are really happy with the cooperation between the two countries, and at the same time, we will make every effort to achieve this in the next high-level strategic council in Istanbul, under the supervision of the prime ministers of the two countries, as soon as this year ends. We have discussed various issues in detail and on this occasion, we would like to thank my dear brother Ahmet Davutoğlu for the hospitality they have shown us. As they ordered, representatives of 11 ministries in Iraq were also in Ankara. They covered all technical issues in detail. We will continue our discussions on this issue intensively in the coming weeks.
 
 
 
 Thank you so much.
 
 MINISTER: I would like to express my condolences once again. I wished my dear friend at the meeting yesterday. May God have mercy on him, I offer my condolences to all our Iraqi brothers and sisters for this attack.
 
 
 
 QUESTION: I wonder if Turkey and Iran, together with the Iraqi Government, can take a joint action and accept a joint initiative to clear Northern Iraq of the PKK and all other terrorist groups such as PJAK and the people's mujahideen. And at the same time, the Iraqi government does not have the authority to keep all Iraqi lands under control at the military level, there is such a thing.
 
 
 
 MINISTER: We do not see the terrorist organization and all terrorist activities as a threat to one country, but to all brotherly peoples in the region. In other words, these terrorist attacks are against all friendly and neighboring countries and peoples. It is not in the interest of any people. Therefore, we attach great importance to raising awareness in our region against terrorism, creating a common working culture and creating a common working atmosphere. In this regard, we have always intensified our contacts with all neighboring countries, Iran, Iraq, Syria and the regional administration in northern Iraq, and we will intensify them from now on. The disappearance of the terrorist threat in the region will first of all create a great area of ​​economic prosperity. Terrorism deals a huge blow to economic prosperity, it deals a blow to cooperation. In this regard, our work continues with all neighboring countries. This is what I will say in a nutshell.
 
 
 
 IRAQ FOREIGN MINISTER HOSHYAR ZEBARI- This issue requires the dependencies of the Iraqi Government and is also related to the implementation of the Constitution on its territory. For this reason, it is in no way acceptable for any group to engage in transboundary acts or terrorist attempts, and to kill civilians. And especially it is not possible to move to Iraqi territory. In my opinion, no country accepts this and it is not allowed. In fact, it takes time and time. I wonder if the Iraqi government really has the power to control all Iraqi territories, all borders, or not? As it is known, Iraq is going through a transition period. After the American forces left, and indeed, this is no easy matter. We are already facing terrorism even in the middle of Baghdad. But this does not mean that I will not cooperate, at the bilateral level, at the security level, at the intelligence level, we cooperated with Turkey, essentially a tripartite mechanism, between Turkey, America and Iraq, we cooperated against the PKK's activities. At the same time, we have the same understanding and consensus with Iran. But its final decision, in my opinion, depends on cooperation at the bilateral level. In my opinion, we can resolve these issues within the framework of bilateral agreements between Iraq and Turkey in order to eliminate these threats and these fears regarding their national security. We cooperated between America and Iraq, we cooperated against the PKK's activities. At the same time, we have the same understanding and consensus with Iran. But its final decision, in my opinion, depends on cooperation at the bilateral level. In my opinion, we can resolve these issues within the framework of bilateral agreements between Iraq and Turkey in order to eliminate these threats and these fears regarding their national security.

But its final decision, in my opinion, depends on cooperation at the bilateral level. In my opinion, we can resolve these issues within the framework of bilateral agreements between Iraq and Turkey in order to eliminate these threats and these fears regarding their national security.
 
 
 
 Another issue is; this is also necessary, we need to draw attention to it. Respect for good neighborly relations there. This problem will end. Now, tomorrow, or there are some serious political initiatives to resolve these issues. So this is not a problem that will go on forever. For this reason, the emphasis should be on the foundations and future of these relations, and we need to look at this issue from a longer perspective. Therefore, our understandings are common with the Turkish side, and we also understand Turkey's legitimate doubts. In particular, we sympathize with these threats to their borders and national security. However, this subject needs practical operations and operations in the field.
 
 
 
 We thank you.
 
 
 
 QUESTION- Sevil Küçükkosum. Hurriyet Daily News. I want to ask both ministers. For many years, many mechanisms and methods, both double and triple, have been used to fight the PKK. However, as Mr. Davutoğlu said, it cannot be said that Turkey has achieved satisfactory results. Could you give information about the planned new methods and mechanisms that you will implement from now on, that is, if there is a consensus on this issue? Also, you said that you welcomed Mr. Maliki's proposal, what do you think about the issue of sending troops to the north of Iraq to fight the PKK, and do you plan to negotiate with the Kurdish administration on this issue and take steps? Thanks.
 
 
 
 IRAQ FOREIGN MINISTER HOŞYAR ZEBARI- The PKK issue is not really a new issue. For more than 20 years or so, we do not believe that this will be resolved with a meeting or a statement or an attitude. Many transactions are needed by Iraq, by Turkey. Therefore, our relations should not focus solely on this issue. As you know, we have a lot of common interests. But this is also a common concern. That's why we need to take steps and we need to allow the PKK issue to poison the cooperation dialogue between the two countries. Therefore, contrary to what you think, there is no disagreement in our attitudes regarding this issue. And as to how to oppose and how to end this problem. But how?
 
 
 
 MINISTER: Of course, there is a need to intensify the work on this issue and to take more effective measures. These activities have existed in the past, but will not be in the future. The PKK needs to receive this message of determination from us very strongly on this issue. The message of Mr. Maliki the day before is important because it is a message of determination. And we hope that, as I said, Iraq will show the power and capacity to unilaterally control its own territory and such a problem will disappear. If this is not possible unilaterally from the middle, as my dear friend said, we will take measures to get rid of this trouble together by operating all kinds of ways, all kinds of methods, all kinds of mechanisms in the most effective way. While these measures are being taken, of course, Turkey will continue its determination to take all kinds of security measures against the terrorist organization that threatens it unilaterally. Thank you so much."

He is an important person who has visited Turkey frequently for a long time and has always seen Turkey as his home since the 1990s. As you know, the relations between Turkey and our Kurdish brothers in northern Iraq have gained momentum recently. I visited Erbil in 2009, our Prime Minister also visited this year. And from there, our esteemed Prime Minister gave a very strong message to the whole world. Turks and Kurds, no matter what country they are in, are eternal brothers. And this eternal brotherhood, eternal brotherhood will be strengthened on this ground and carried to the future. Especially the recent developments in our region give great importance to the further development of this brotherhood. Because while all structures are being rebuilt in our region, this brotherhood between Turks and Kurds has a constructive role and will have a lasting impact on our region. The important factor that threatens these fraternal relations is the activities of the terrorist organization. The activities of the terrorist organization harm not only Turkey, not only Turks and Kurds in Turkey, but also our Kurdish brothers and sisters in northern Iraq. And it presents a situation that threatens this eternal brotherhood and tries to undermine this brotherhood. It also harms our Kurdish brothers in northern Iraq. And it presents a situation that threatens this eternal brotherhood and tries to undermine this brotherhood. It also harms our Kurdish brothers in northern Iraq. And it presents a situation that threatens this eternal brotherhood and tries to undermine this brotherhood. 
 
 
 
 That's why, lastly, in Hakkari, Çukurca, our 24 brothers, among whom there are our citizens of Kurdish origin, we also have citizens of Turkish origin, we have citizens from all over Anatolia. When we lost our martyrs, Mr. Barzani called our Prime Minister and conveyed their condolences and solidarity. they expressed their feelings. And on the very same day, they sent Mr. Nechirvan Barzani to Turkey, we had extensive meetings with Mr. Nechirvan Barzani and we clearly expressed our expectations from both Iraq and the northern Iraqi regional administration.
 
 
 
 Later, Mr. Mesud Barzani called our Prime Minister to express his condolences due to the Van earthquake, and the meetings were held again. Now they are visiting our country to continue our face-to-face talks on this issue. The fact that this visit takes place just before the holiday has a very symbolic meaning. From here, we would like to declare, once again, that on this holiday, on all the holidays that will last until eternity, Turks and Kurds will live together as brothers and sisters in this geography, as a family.
 
 
 
 And again, on the occasion of these meetings, we would like to express once again that all Turks and Kurds, Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government will act together against this terrorist activity that seeks to strike a blow to this brotherhood; essentially, this was our message to Mr. Barzani. It is both our right and our responsibility to expect everyone to take a stand against this organization that harms this brotherhood. From now on, we expect a very clear attitude and active support and solidarity from the Kurdish Regional Government of northern Iraq against terrorism.
 
 We had a very nice meeting a while ago, and we shared our strategic perspectives for the future. Now we will be together at dinner and we will continue our talks. I would like to welcome Mr. Barzani, who visited our country with the awareness of solidarity on such an important day. Our country is your country, our home is your home, and this brotherhood will last forever; we express it.
 
 
 
 BARZANI: Thank you very much for this opportunity. I am very pleased to meet and visit our Turkish brothers again.
 
 
 
 With the coming of Eid-al-Adha, I congratulate all the people of Turkey.
 
 
 
 Our relationship with the Kurdistan region, Iraq in general, and Turkey gives priority and importance to us. And our security is tied together. We will make all our efforts to ensure that this security that we have together is strong and develops further.
 
 
 
 Our relationship with Turkey is important to us and our relationship has developed considerably. Especially Mr. Prime Minister, after the visit of Turkey's Prime Minister to Erbil, I hope that no action will lead to a vacuum or collapse of the historical Kurdish and Turkish brotherhood. And we believe that we will discuss all issues with the authorities of the Turkish State and reach a good result.
 
 
 
 Thank you very much."

 This incident is also disturbing since it demonstrates that some circles troubled by the development of Turkish-Greek friendship are still active. 
 
 It is clear that allowing to spread terrorist propaganda for the PKK, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by the NATO and the EU, is not consistent with the relevant decisions of NATO and EU, nor with international obligations within the context of combatting terrorism. As a matter of fact, this point has been pointed out in the press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece. 
 
 H.E. Mr. Ahmet Davutoglu, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, expressed our reaction to the aforementioned incident and emphasized our disappointment during a phone conversation he had on 29 November with H.E. Mr. Avramopulos, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece. 
 
 The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, Mr. Avramopoulos expressed their deep sorrow for this event which he explicitly condemned, stated that press reports implying that the Government of Greece has tolerated it are entirely baseless. Futhermore, indicating the importance they attached to the relations with Turkey, he expressed that in the light of the investigation conducted the necessary was done against those officials of the War Museum of the Ministry of National Defense of Greece, who apparently have assumed a role in arranging the aforementioned event. This point has also been indicated in the press release of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece. 
 
 Greece is a country to which we attach importance as our neighbour and ally. Our relations have been developing in a multi-faceted way and we maintain our wish to further advance our bilateral cooperation on a positive agenda. We continue to believe that our relations would further develop as long as this remains as a shared will."

I say ordinary, but we haven't been able to do it for such a long time that it started to lose its ordinary quality, but I wanted to get together before the holiday before it's too late.
 
 On this occasion, I congratulate all of you on the upcoming Ramadan Feast, and I wish you a happy and beautiful holiday with your families.
 
 In fact, we are experiencing a sad development for the Foreign Affairs community and our press community. Yesterday, we lost our retired ambassador, Mr. İnal Batu, who previously served as the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On this occasion, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs community, I express my condolences to his grieving family, and we wish God's mercy on him. But since I know that you know him very well, I wanted to share this news with you on this occasion.
 
 I don't have much to say at the beginning. As you know, there was a visit by our Minister to Iran yesterday, we came from there. Minister Çavuşoğlu had very productive contacts there. He had bilateral contacts with the other guests who attended, as well as a bilateral meeting with the newly elected President Mr. Rouhani and the newly appointed Foreign Minister. There are no incoming guest visits or any foreign visits that we can see in the upcoming period.
 
 On this occasion, let me complete my first words, if there are questions, I will take them.
 
 Sevil from Hürriyet Daily News.
 
 QUESTION: Hello, Mr. Levent, I had two questions. First; The first was also featured in some newspapers. The minister had statements that there was a 6-item solution plan for Egypt, can you give us details about it? In addition, are there any elements approved by the Morsi side or Sisi regarding these articles, and with whom do you have your contacts regarding this matter?
 
 I also have a question; There was a claim in the newspaper again yesterday, that the extradition of an Iranian citizen named Hüseyin Tanideh, who was caught in Turkey for supplying materials related to Iran's nuclear program, was requested by Germany, that Interpol sought him, but Turkey did not extradite him. Is this news true? If true, could you give some more details? Thanks.
 
 ANSWER: First of all, let me start with your second question because there will be a very short answer. However, of course, since there is a request for extradition, it will perhaps be a subject of greater interest to our Ministries of Interior and Justice, but I will still investigate and try to provide you with additional information if there is any additional information.
 
 In the road map regarding Egypt, there are statements of our Minister that appeared in various newspapers today, there is not much that I can add to them. But as you all know, we, as Turkey, have been conducting intense diplomatic traffic with the relevant parties in order to return to democracy as soon as possible in Egypt. On this subject, Minister Çavuşoğlu had phone contacts with many of his interlocutors, whether it was the US Secretary of State, the High Representative of the European Union, the Foreign Ministers of other members of the European Union, as well as the Foreign Ministers from the region. In this context, at least, we are in contact with the international community to adopt a common stance on this issue and to put forward a roadmap that will facilitate the return to democracy in Egypt as soon as possible.
 
 Of course, it is not possible to go into details here, but as stated by our Minister, first of all, the release of elected President Morsi and all political prisoners; Of course, it stands out as the first step. In the continuation of this, we emphasize the necessity of creating a new and civil roadmap through a dialogue process in which all political parties, including the Muslim Brotherhood, will participate. And in the continuation of this, we think that a course of action should be followed within this framework, in whatever way this civil roadmap will emerge. In this framework, as Turkey, we are primarily in intense contact with other actors in the international community, we are trying to establish a common attitude here, and we see that similar views and the same attitude prevail in all our interlocutors, relatively speaking, on this issue. In this context, as you know, there are some delegations from abroad that have gone there recently, and they are making some contacts within this framework. But since it is an ongoing process at this stage, it is not possible to say much beyond that. But as I said at the beginning, Turkey is making an active effort in close contact with all parties in order to return to democracy as soon as possible and to restore democracy in Egypt. Because the return to democracy in Egypt as soon as possible is a very important issue for Egypt, the region and us. It is making an active effort in close contact with all parties in order to return to democracy as soon as possible and to restore democracy in Egypt. Because the return to democracy in Egypt as soon as possible is a very important issue for Egypt, the region and us. It is making an active effort in close contact with all parties in order to return to democracy as soon as possible and to restore democracy in Egypt. Because the return to democracy in Egypt as soon as possible is a very important issue for Egypt, the region and us.
 
 Fulya…
 
 QUESTION: I have three questions. First, what will be Turkey's stance on the approval of sanctions against Iran in the US House of Representatives last month, because Turkey was on the list of exempt countries?
 
 Latter; On a website to Al Qaeda, there was a report that an advisor to the Iraqi Tourism Minister had been kidnapped in Turkey and the kidnappers demanded ransom. Do you have any information about it?
 
 Lastly, in a speech he made to a television channel, the Minister of Foreign Affairs called for Syrian Kurds to join the National Coalition. Did you receive such a signal during Salih Muslim's visit to Turkey? So, will Syrian Kurds take part in this umbrella organization?
 
 Thank you.
 
 ANSWER: Let me start from the end again. The issue of the participation of Syrian Kurds in the national coalition, yes, this issue has been on our agenda for a long time. When our Minister went to Erbil about a year ago, he also met with the representatives of the Syrian Kurdish National Council there, and as we announced to the public at that time, our desire was for the Syrian Kurds to take part in the Coalition with this structure they created. Because we, and in fact the vast majority of the international community, see the Syrian National Coalition as the only legitimate representative of the Syrian people, and we wanted all opposition groups and all segments of the Syrian people to take part in this coalition and continue the struggle within a single structure. We have been voicing this issue with all our interlocutors, with whom we have met on various occasions since then. In the last contacts of the PYD President in Turkey, this issue came to the fore. And the signals we are receiving now are positive. I think the PYD President also touches on this issue in his statements after his visit to Turkey and states that they evaluate this issue positively and that they will make contacts in this direction in the coming period. We will also show any kind of contribution we can make in this regard, facilitating support.
 
 As a matter of fact, it seems like 2-3 days ago, Minister Çavuşoğlu had a meeting with the new President of the Syrian National Coalition, Mr. Jarba, in Istanbul. This was one of the issues discussed in this meeting. In this context, Minister Çavuşoğlu also suggested in this direction, and he called on the Syrian National Coalition to make efforts in this direction. We know that Mr. Jarba also said that they approached this issue positively, that they had a positive approach from the very beginning, and that they would make the necessary contacts in this direction in the coming period. Therefore, we hope that there will be some positive developments in this regard in the coming days.
 
 Regarding the advisor to the Iraqi Tourism Minister, yes, we have the information, we have also received information from the Iraqi authorities on this matter. Maybe it's too early to say that he was just kidnapped, because we have information that no information has been received from him for the last 12 days. We have conveyed the information on this matter to our relevant authorities, other than that, I do not have any additional details. We do not know where, how, why, but our relevant authorities are following this issue and the necessary research is being carried out.
 
 The sanction decision of the US House of Representatives, of course, at this initial stage, is not something that has been finalized yet. However, our stance on this issue is very clear. As you know, we take the binding sanctions decisions of the United Nations Security Council as a basis, and our stance on matters other than that is determined within the framework of our own national decisions.
 
 But perhaps it is necessary to emphasize our principled stance regarding the Iranian nuclear program within this framework. We want this issue to be resolved peacefully as soon as possible through political negotiations and dialogue between the parties. We think that any other coercive measure actually complicates the problem and may create new sources of instability. In that respect, as before, and from now on, especially in the new era that started in Iran, Turkey will continue to do its best to facilitate a peaceful, dialogical political solution process on this issue.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, does PYD Leader Salih Muslim have a recent visit to Ankara or Istanbul?
 
 There was also the message that Iranian President Rouhani viewed the Minister's invitation positively. Will this visit take place soon?
 
 Thank you.
 
 ANSWER: Yes, as we explained after the contact with the PYD President and the meetings in Turkey, which was not the first time, we had met with the PYD twice in the last 2-3 months, this time in Turkey. However, there is a mutual agreement on both sides to continue these contacts. It was agreed that these contacts would continue as long as necessary, as long as the schedules of both sides were appropriate. There is no calendar and date at this stage, but we can easily say that the contacts will continue.
 
 On the other hand, regarding Rouhani's visit, as you know, our Minister attended this swearing-in ceremony on behalf of our President. In this context, an agreement was reached between our Minister of Foreign Affairs and the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the basis of the first comprehensive contact in the upcoming period, to come together to discuss the issues on the agenda of the two countries in a more comprehensive manner. However, following this, there may be a visit by Mr. Rouhani in a way that will allow him to contact our President and Prime Minister. However, at this stage, a date has not been decided yet, but I can say that both sides have a positive approach to this issue.
 
 QUESTION: There was a news that was reflected in the press at the weekend. There were reports that due to the increase in the number of Syrian refugees, Turkey would take new measures and that the camps that it would set up from now on would be set up on the Syrian border, that is, on the Syrian side, and that these camps would be in effect at the United Nations to protect them. Do AFAD and Turkey have such plans? On the other hand, how do you approach the news regarding the Kurdish National Conference that Turkey will be watching, and that it will be present at the conference through the MIT officials and the Erbil Consulate there as a spectator?
 
 ANSWER: Yes, it is not possible at this stage to talk about a specific plan regarding Syria. However, it is a well-known fact that the humanitarian situation in Syria is getting more and more dire. This creates serious risks and pressures not only within Syria, but also on the countries neighboring Syria. As of now, there are nearly 500 thousand Syrians in Turkey, 200,000 of whom are in camps. Likewise, a similar situation exists in other countries neighboring Syria such as Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan. In this respect, Turkey has been making the necessary calls for a more effective solution to the humanitarian situation in Syria for a very long time. It also makes the necessary calls to the international community, We are both making contacts and making the necessary calls on this issue, especially the United Nations, as well as the relevant specific institutions and bodies. In that context, as our Minister has recently mentioned in a television interview, we are in close contact with the United Nations in terms of being prepared for new and larger refugee influxes that may be encountered in the coming period, we are in close contact with the United Nations. In this context, as the four neighboring countries of Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, we brought forward the proposal to hold a meeting with the United Nations solely and exclusively for the humanitarian situation in Syria. I guess that this meeting will be possible in Geneva at the beginning of September, contacts and studies on this subject are continuing. All aspects of these issues will be discussed at this meeting. According to this,
 
 Regarding the Kurdish National Conference, at this stage, there is no determined element in terms of Turkey's monitoring or participation. However, the subject of the conference was also discussed during the visit of Mr. Nechirvan Barzani to Turkey. As we expressed to some friends that day, we had the opportunity to convey our primary views and expectations on this matter at first hand. In this context, we have conveyed our priority expectations of respecting the borders, not acting against international law, and taking a firm stance against terrorism and violence. In this context, Mr. Nechirvan Barzani also told us that they will not engage in any action or effort that will deepen Turkey's concerns or ignore Turkey's concerns. In this context, I can say that we continue to follow the issue closely.
 
 QUESTION: Mr. Levent, there were claims that a resolution in the direction of the Palestine Liberation Organization would be made in the National Kurdish Conference and that there would be another in this direction to the UN. What will be Turkey's stance if such a decision is made? As a second question, if AFAD officials or the Red Crescent set up a camp within the borders of Syria, will the Turkish military ensure the security of these camps or will they go beyond the border? Thank you.
 
 ANSWER: Unfortunately, it is not possible to give a clear answer to both of your questions at this stage, because they are both very speculative. In other words, I don't think it would be right at this stage to express what kind of reaction we will react to such or such a decision that will come out of the Kurdish National Conference. First of all, let the conference convene and take decisions, it can be evaluated accordingly. We have conveyed our priorities to the other party or our interlocutors within the framework of the three priority expectations I have just stated.
 
 On the other hand, if a camp is established within the Syrian border, as I said before, how and by whom the camps will be established, and how security will be ensured, in relation to this, as I said before, in the light of the meetings we will hold on this subject, the meetings planned to be held and the concrete decisions that will come out of this, maybe it will be clarified. are matters. At this stage, our priority is to inform the international community that the humanitarian situation in Syria is getting more and more serious and to ensure that effective steps are taken by the international community, especially the United Nations. As you know, in this matter, not only with the United Nations, but also with other countries in the contacts of our Minister and Prime Minister,
 
 If there are no further questions, then we can gradually end our regular press conference. Thank you all so much for coming. Once again, I congratulate you on your holiday, I wish you a beautiful and happy holiday with your families. We may even have a little holiday candy on the way out, so I thank you very much again, I wish you all a happy holiday, thank you."

 As you know, we opened an Embassy in Myanmar at the beginning of last year. During this period, our bilateral relations with Myanmar developed rapidly. However, we suffered a great deal especially in the last summer months due to the events that took place in Myanmar and Arakan region. On 8-10 August last year, on these developments in Myanmar, where despite the geographical distance, our historical ties are extremely strong, who helped us with all the means at his disposal in the War of Independence and where many of our martyrs were found, we were together with our Prime Minister's Honorable Refika, as you all followed. We visited Myanmar and had the opportunity to make observations as statesmen, the first foreign representatives to go to the Arakan region after decades. After that visit, From August 2012 until today, we have closely followed every event related to Myanmar. We held bilateral meetings with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar, both in the context of bilateral relations and at the margins of the international community and organizations. Finally, at the United Nations General Assembly. In Myanmar, there have been some attacks against Muslim minorities other than Arakan in the recent period. In order to improve the situation in Myanmar and to keep the issue of human rights on the agenda, we have been engaged in intense activities before international organizations. In this context, I made a long presentation at the Foreign Ministers Meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held in Djibouti in November following my visit in August last year, and then we brought up the issue of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation establishing a Rohingya Contact Group. This contact group was formed this year. Also, during my visit to Myanmar, I offered a delegation from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to visit Myanmar during my meetings with the President Thein Sein and my foreign minister. At that time, this proposal was generally accepted. We followed this offer later. Following the formation of the Rohingya Contact Group this year, this visit was planned with the direct follow-up of our Embassy there, with the efforts of Turkey and with the initiatives of the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Mr. We followed this offer later. Following the formation of the Rohingya Contact Group this year, this visit was planned with the direct follow-up of our Embassy there, with the efforts of Turkey and with the initiatives of the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Mr. We followed this offer later. Following the formation of the Rohingya Contact Group this year, this visit was planned with the direct follow-up of our Embassy there, with the efforts of Turkey and with the initiatives of the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Mr.
 
 Tomorrow, hopefully, we will hold bilateral contacts in Myanmar, and the next day we will move to Arakan, Rohingya region. We will visit both Muslim and Buddhist camps there. I will also deliver 4 tractors and some agricultural materials that we donated to the Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation. In the meantime, our work on the establishment of our martyrdom continues. Plans and projects have been made, and I will have the opportunity to see them on site. Therefore, this visit is important both as a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation within the delegation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and I will also make a bilateral visit by making bilateral contacts. Myanmar is a country we care about. The inner peace and tranquility of Myanmar is important. However, the great suffering of the Northern Arakan Muslims in Myanmar recently, Turkey has done and will continue to do what it has to do in relieving the pain. This is our historical debt. As I have just mentioned, we have never forgotten their prayers and direct assistance to our country during the War of Independence, and from now on we will continue to follow the situation of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar on every platform and on every ground, and we will continue to make suggestions to improve human rights. Let me take it if you have any questions. We will continue to follow the situation of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar on all grounds and to make suggestions for improvements in human rights. Let me take it if you have any questions. We will continue to follow the situation of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar on all grounds and to make suggestions for improvements in human rights. Let me take it if you have any questions.
 
 QUESTION- Sir, you have made some statements on this matter, but there has been an announcement of the administration of some groups in Syria. We know Turkey's objections. What kind of policy will Turkey follow in this regard and how do you evaluate its timing? What effect might this development have, especially as the preparations for Geneva-2 and efforts to unite the dissidents continue?
 
 And Sir, are the details of your Washington visit clear?
 
 FOREIGN MINISTER AHMET DAVUTOĞLU- Yes, if you want, I would like to mention it first, as it is a follow-up visit to Washington. I will return to my country on Friday or early Saturday morning. I will depart for Washington on Saturday afternoon. Hopefully, we will hold talks in Washington on Sunday and Monday, and we will return to our country on Monday evening. My contacts in Washington are in the context of a bilateral official visit. As you know, Mr. Kerry visited our country many times after he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but I had not had the opportunity to make a return visit to him. Except for the visit we made with our Prime Minister in May, I went to New York for the United Nations General Assembly during this period, I had not visited Washington. Therefore, we were indebted to Mr. Kerry at least 3 times. During our contacts in New York, we decided to make a comprehensive visit to not only the Syria issue but also other issues as there were so many agenda items to discuss. I will meet with Ms. Kerry, I will meet with Congress, I will meet with Ms. National Security Advisor Ms. Susan Rice, I will also speak at a think-tank and have contacts with various non-governmental organizations. Since it is a 1.5-day visit, we will complete the program intensively and return to our country. I will also speak at a think-tank and have contacts with various non-governmental organizations. Since it is a 1.5-day visit, we will complete the program intensively and return to our country. I will also speak at a think-tank and have contacts with various non-governmental organizations. Since it is a 1.5-day visit, we will complete the program intensively and return to our country.
 
 As for the developments in Syria; The news in the press today is that there are efforts to establish an autonomous administration in Syria. As you say, timing is extremely significant. Last week, talks were held between the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Kurdish National Council, and as a result of these talks, it was agreed that the Syrian Kurdish National Council would join the Syrian National Coalition. Thus, it was possible for the Kurdish elements in Syria to join the Syrian National Coalition, which we recognize as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. This has long been something we have encouraged both sides to do, and it has echoed in the international community as a very positive development.
 
 As you followed yesterday, the Syrian National Coalition officially announced that it would attend the Geneva meeting with our encouragement, and it was also confirmed at the Geneva Conference that the Syrian Kurdish National Council would also take part in this structure.
 
 While these talks are taking place, the PYD and PYD-linked elements have taken such a step today. We have never made any distinction between ethnic and sectarian groups in Syria. We have always behaved in a principled way and expected to be treated in a principled way at all times. During the constant contacts with the PYD, both from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from other subjects, three main issues that I declared to the public were always on the agenda.
 
 First; adopting an open stance towards the regime, taking a clear stance against the regime's oppression and oppression.
 
 Latter; Taking part in the Syrian opposition, not adopting an ambivalent attitude, not displaying an opportunist attitude by acting on the side of the regime one day and as an opposition the next, showing a certain attitude where it stands and where it is made.
 
 Thirdly; The fate of Syria is in the hands of the Syrian people. No one can impose anything on the Syrian people from outside or inside. Therefore, until the Syrian people have a legitimately elected parliament and they adopt a principled stance on any administration, no fait accompli, de facto situation, no such step should be taken.
 
 Of course, some local authorities may emerge in this chaos environment. In many places, structures in the form of city authorities are emerging, coordination boards and so on. However, adopting an attitude that will draw a border in Syria, cause any internal division and bring counter-steps to the agenda is playing with fire, this is not the right attitude. Because there will be such an announcement of group X today, group Y tomorrow, another group the next day. You see, Syria is basically divided between certain areas in the ethnic and sectarian areas. We have always come to emphasize that our Kurdish brothers in Syria, like our other Arab, Turkmen, Nusayri, Druze, and all our brothers, are the main element of Syria and have equal rights with them, so we have never made any ethnic or sectarian discrimination.
 
 However, there are also very serious pressures, especially against our Kurdish brothers, in the regions that the PYD has been under control with the support of the regime in the last period, and there are intense complaints about this issue. We hope that common sense will be acted upon and no new areas of conflict will arise in Syria. Making some temporary arrangements, as I said, the formation of some buildings from city to city may be understandable or seen as a natural course in this chaos environment. However, to draw a map within Syria or to create ethnic and sectarian lines between one or another regions within Syria would be a very wrong move. The steps to be taken in this regard cannot be seen as legitimate or seen by Turkey, neighboring countries, or the international community for any reason.
 
 In that respect, while this positive atmosphere between the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Kurdish National Council has emerged, it is necessary to support this atmosphere. The PYD also has to make a decision, is it for or against the regime? Do they want to play a role in Syria's future by standing by a regime that has been oppressing the Kurdish people for decades, or by taking part in the Syrian National Coalition, which has voiced the just reactions of the Syrian people with extremely peaceful methods? This is the issue that will determine how they will go to Geneva.
 
 QUESTION- Prime Minister Erdogan will hold a meeting with Barzani in Diyarbakir this weekend. BDP expressed its discomfort in this regard. Ahmet Türk said that we had invited him in Nevruz, but Barzani did not come. What will you say, sir?
 
 FOREIGN MINISTER AHMET DAVUTOĞLU- Now, frankly, I cannot understand being disturbed by such a situation. The inviter is the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, and the responding President of the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government, Mr. Mesut Barzani. Therefore, if the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey invites someone in any region, it is necessary to respond to it, and no one should be disturbed by it.
 
 I emphasized on one occasion yesterday, this visit is actually an indicator of self-confidence and normalization. Turkey has adopted a policy of establishing close relations with all related communities beyond its borders. Our government also implements this policy effectively. As it is natural for our esteemed Prime Minister to go to Kosovo, to go to Sarajevo, as it is natural for him to talk about many projects on Nakhchivan with the President of Azerbaijan, Mr. Aliyev, it is also about the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government, which is an inseparable part of Iraq, Erbil and the regional administration, It is so natural for him to meet and discuss matters related to Northern Iraq. And how, from other neighboring countries, our historians, our kin communities with whom we share history together,
 
 There is already a regional government defined in the Iraqi constitution and we have an increasing cooperation with this regional government in recent years. There are very intense Turkish investments there. When you go to Erbil, you come across Turkish companies in every street as if you have entered an Anatolian city. I visited Baghdad, Najaf and Karbala 2-3 days ago in Iraq, we have the same ties there. Therefore, this visit is of great importance both for the bilateral relations we have established with the regional administration and for the unity and integrity of Iraq. In addition, Mr. Barzani will be in our country on the occasion of the mass wedding, which is a beautiful occasion, and a visit will take place in a festive atmosphere. Two very valuable artists, two valuable artists, Mr. Tatlıses and Mr. Pervez, who have a place in the hearts of all Turks and Kurds, will also contribute to this. It is only necessary to be happy, it is a holiday, this is a wedding, no one should be disturbed by the wedding. We will be together with our brothers and sisters around us at the wedding, God forbid, even if there is pain and mourning, we will be together at that too.
 
 Just as we mourned the death of Hazrat Hussein in Najaf and Karbala with our Shiite brothers yesterday, we will experience a great happiness, a wedding and a mass wedding ceremony together with our Kurdish brothers in Diyarbakir at the weekend. No one should be offended by this. This is the emergence of natural cultural ties and is an indication of the self-confidence of Turkey, the Government of the Republic of Turkey. These relations will continue to increase in the future. Those who are disturbed should read some history, develop a future perspective, and they will see that these relations benefit everyone and bring peace to the region. At a time when ethnic and sectarian conflicts are wanted to be created in the Middle East Region, this visit will actually give the most correct message to the entire region. Let's be together in pain and happiness, shoulder to shoulder everywhere, to those who want to divide us on ethnic and sectarian basis, Let's stand shoulder to shoulder against those who want to confront them, this is the message to be given from Diyarbakır. Everyone should be proud of this message, find peace, and no one should be disturbed by this message.

 Turkey, with this understanding, actively participates since the first day in the work of the International Coalition Against DAESH, and provides support to its friendly neighbor Iraq, one-third of whose territory is under the occupation of this terrorist organization, in its fight.
 
 In this context, Turkey has so far provided training to more than 5.000 Iraqi personnel and have also provided to the Iraqi Government and the KRG with various military equipment. 
 
 Lately, the training program run by Turkey since March 2015 in the training camp established in Bashiqa and the force protection measures taken for the security of the camp and the trainers have been subjected to intentional, exaggerated and inaccurate reporting and commentary. 
 
 The mandate of the Turkish elements in Bashiqa is to provide training to Iraqi volunteers within the scope of the fight against DAESH, and they have not been given combat duties and responsibilities.

 Turkish military authorities have issued a statement concerning this development. Our elements in the camp have immediately retaliated against the attack as necessary and destroyed some DAESH positions that were identified. 
 
 Two Iraqi volunteers that were being trained in the camp, including an officer, were martyrized and four others were wounded in the attack. We wish God's mercy upon our martyrized Iraqi brothers and convey our condolences to their relatives and the people of Iraq and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded. 
 
 This attack justifies our concerns about the security of the Bashiqa/Zelikan camp, which forms an important element of our support for the fight of Iraq against DAESH, and the necessity of the protection element we wanted to deploy there. 
 
 Unfortunately, the activity that has been continuing for quite some time in this camp with the sole aim of providing support for Iraq, has, a result of exaggerated news spread deliberately by some circles, been turned into a problem incompatible with the friendship and cooperation against DAESH between Iraq and Turkey. These campaigns have made the camp and the personnel visible target for the terrorist organization and this unfortunately instilled confidence in the terrorist organization. 
 
 Turkey has always stood by Iraq during its difficult times. It has been the one of the countries that has displayed utmost sensitivity concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of this country as well.

As if this was not enough, the regime is now directly attacking the people in East Aleppo with all kinds of weapons and committing mass executions of civilians.

In this regard, we have been stressing that at a time when critical developments are unfolding in the region, such a move would benefit neither the KRG nor Iraq and that it would have negative consequences which will cause further instability.

 We see the KRG’s decision to hold the independence referendum on 25 September 2017, which runs counter to our advice and warnings, within the above-stated context and consider that it will be a grave mistake. Preserving Iraq’s territorial integrity and political unity is one of the fundamental principles of Turkey’s Iraq policy. This principle is a prerequisite for lasting stability, peace, security and prosperity in the region.
 
 The most important challenge that confronts Iraq, which has made significant strides in the fight against DEASH and appears close to success in this campaign, is to recover from the profound humanitarian, political, economic and social devastation that DEASH has inflicted and to achieve lasting stability by thoroughly rebuilding the country. The way to accomplish this is to continue the solidarity shown during the fight against DEASH after DEASH is defeated and to tackle every issue that concerns the future of the country within the framework of international and constitutional legitimacy. Furthermore, given the present extraordinary circumstances that the people of Iraq are in, it is obvious that a referendum which will also include the disputed territories will be far from reflecting the will of the people.
 
 In this respect, instead of undermining Iraq’s territorial integrity, it is necessary to act with a spirit of reconciliation, dialogue and inclusiveness among all different elements constituting Iraq, by advancing the methods that will strengthen the unity and cohesion of the country and that depend on the principle of decentralization as well as on power and authority sharing which is enshrined in the Iraqi constitution."

 It is important that the international community and particularly the regional countries should maintain the consistent approach they displayed with regard to the referendum and should refrain from recognizing the consequences of this illegitimate endeavor.
 
 In the subsequent process it is a fundamental necessity that the KRG leadership should restore commonsense and should adopt a policy that serves the long term peace and prosperity of the whole of the Iraqi people, rather than seeking short term political interests and utopian aspirations.

The aforementioned terrorist organization is thus trying to gather material for its black propaganda activities against Turkey.

Turkey continues its efforts to normalize the situation in Afrin and facilitate the safe return of local people.
 
 The claim that the humanitarian situation in Afrin is a source of ""deep concern"" under the current circumstances is completely unfounded. The main concern in northern Syria is the cooperation of the countries we know as our allies with PKK/PYD/YPG terrorists.

 In spite of this, some countries and circles voiced a number of allegations and comments, which were also reflected in various international media outlets.
 
 The Operation is being conducted on the basis of international law, in accordance with our right of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and resolutions of the UN Security Council on fight against terrorism.
 
 PYD/YPG is the Syrian offshoot of PKK, which is recognized as a terrorist organization also by the EU and NATO. During the planning and execution phases of the operation, only PYD/YPG elements and their hideouts, shelters, emplacements, weapons, vehicles and equipment are being targeted. All necessary measures are taken to prevent any harm to civilians and any damage to civilian infrastructure. Allegations that the operation would lead to a new humanitarian crisis and a mass migration flow are fabricated in order to discredit Turkey's counter-terrorism efforts.
 
 Turkey fought against DEASH terrorist organization in Syria more than any other country and paid the heaviest price. Countries which insist on the mistake of combating DEASH by using another terrorist organization, remain idle to PYD/YPG’s release of DEASH detainees in line with the interest of the terrorist organization and even refrain from repatriating their own citizens who are foreign terrorist fighters in the ranks of DEASH, do not have the right to lecture Turkey on the fight against DEASH.
 
 Turkey has no plans whatsoever to modify the demographic structure in the operation area. Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, PYD/YPG terrorist organization has oppressed and intimidated the local population, the Syrian Kurds in particular, and forcibly displaced them. The crimes which PYD/YPG committed against humanity, first and foremost the practices of ethnic cleansing, have been documented by independent international organizations.
 
 Preservation of the territorial integrity and political unity of its neighbor, Syria, is essential for Turkey. Certain countries, which explicitly or implicitly support the separatist agenda of PYD/YPG terrorist organization, are making baseless accusations against Turkey on this matter. This is a manifestation of their frustration for the disruption of their plans to divide Syria.
 
 The allegation that Operation Peace Spring would damage efforts to reach a political solution in Syria is far from reality. Turkey is one of the few countries that exerted maximum and genuine efforts to establish the Constitutional Committee, in close cooperation with other Astana guarantors and the UN. Pursuing a separatist agenda that undermines the principle of territorial integrity and political unity of Syria, on which a political solution must be built upon, PYD/YPG cannot be regarded as a legitimate representative of any segment of the Syrian people. Fighting against such a terrorist organization will only contribute to the advancement of the political process.
 
 Our main expectation from the international community, particularly from our Allies, is to support our fight against terrorism. As it did in the past, Turkey will continue to firmly counter all kinds of terrorist organizations."

 We are not actually surprised by this decision taken by those who are constantly hosting terrorists in their Parliament.
 
 As previously stated on every occasion, our operation is conducted on the basis of international law, in accordance with our right of self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and resolutions of the UN Security Council on fight against terrorism. The operation has targeted PYD/YPG, the PKK offshoot in Syria, which is also recognized by the EU and NATO as terrorist organizations, their shelters, refuges, positions, weapons, tools and equipment and all necessary measures have been taken in order to prevent any harm to civilians and damage to civilian infrastructure.
 
 Furthermore, the legitimacy of this operation has been approved by our agreements with the USA and Russia.
 
 With the statements we have made repeatedly so far to the international public and to our foreign official counterparts at the highest level, all the claims in this EP resolution have been denied and the necessary information have been provided.
 
 Despite all our statements, the European Parliament has insisted on a biased position lacking of common sense towards Turkey, by adopting a decision incompatible with the facts.
 
 Instead of showing solidarity with Turkey who is fighting against PKK/PYD/YPG and DEASH arising from Syria, and struggling with illegal migration, the EP has preferred to serve the agenda of a terrorist organization and to rely on its ungrounded accusations.
 
 This decision does not serve to the efforts aiming to develop relations and cooperation between the newly elected EP in May and Turkey.
 
 This decision shows that the EP cannot properly follow the important developments in the regional and global arena, assess the causes and the consequences of these developments in an objective and holistic way and that it is unable to develop sound and relevant strategies. We consider the efforts to link the developments on the Syrian crisis with irrelevant issues such as the Customs Union and pre-accession funds as a great mistake.
 
 The EP and the EU, instead of being grateful to Turkey, a candidate country to the EU and a NATO ally, for this operation which accelerates the political solution process in Syria, prevents separatism, formation of a terror zone and the efforts to create a demographic change in the border of Europe and NATO, protects the unity and territorial integrity of Syria, prevents further irregular migration and helps Syrians to return to their country safely and voluntarily, continue to take imprudent conclusions.
 
 As an inseparable part of Europe, Turkey is aware that its security is directly linked to the security of Europe. This is why, until today, Turkey has contributed to the security of Europe and has made important sacrifices to this end. Turkey is determined to pursue this stance. No power and no resolution can prevent Turkey from taking steps for its national security."

 It is well understood that France has adopted these resolutions upon the frustration of its endeavours to establish a terror state in Syria.
 
 By taking such steps, the French Parliament and the French government which supports these resolutions once again declared to the world that they side with PYD/YPG, the Syrian off-shoot of PKK, an EU-designated terrorist organization. For us, the attitude of the parliament of this country, where terrorists are hosted at the highest-level at the Elysée Palace, is not surprising.
 
 Despite Turkey’s repeated warnings to its Allies against partnering with the PYD/YPG terrorist organization against another one, namely DEASH; France, under the guise of combatting DEASH, has supported a terrorist organization that poses an existential threat to Turkey’s national security and has insisted on the mistake of identifying Syrian Kurds with PYD/YPG.
 
 The so-called “PYD/YPG romanticism”, which paralyzes the French Parliament’s and Government’s perception of reality, has blinded France’s eyes and deafened its ears against the oppression of PYD/YPG in all areas under its yoke, primarily to Arabs and the very Kurds it claims to represent as well as to Turkmens and Christians.
 
 As previously expressed on every occasion, Operation Peace Spring was carried out on the basis of international law, in accordance with our right of self-defense outlined in Article 51 of the UN Charter and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the fight against terrorism. The legitimacy of the operation was also reaffirmed by our recent agreements with the US and Russia.
 
 We previously denied or elucidated all claims raised by the members of the Parliament and Government officials during the decision-making processes in the Parliament with our statements made so far to the international community and to our foreign interlocutors at the highest level. The French Parliament's adoption of resolutions that are incompatible with facts despite all our initiatives and statements can only be explained with its bias and lack of common sense towards Turkey, and with France’s despair with respect to Syria.
 
 No country can lecture Turkey on combating DEASH. A state that even hesitates to assume the responsibility of its citizens in Syria who joined DEASH, has no right at all to make accusations against Turkey which engaged in close quarter combat on the ground against DEASH, lost martyrs and continuously conducted counter-DEASH operations.
 
 It is only a historical irony that those who claim that Operation Peace Spring would interrupt efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian conflict, adopted the latest of these resolutions on the very same day when the Constitutional Committee met for the first time, bringing a new impetus to the political process.
 
 We once again invite the Parliament and Government of France to side with their NATO and European ally Turkey, not with terrorists in the fight against terrorism, and to show solidarity with Turkey."

This is an explicit attempt to undermine the law.
 
 This ruling, which exonerates a terrorist organization with ideological motives, is exemplary as it comes from a country that presumes to lecture Turkey on the rule of law.
 
 This ruling of the Belgian judiciary means clear support to the PKK, a listed terrorist organization by the EU, which is responsible for the death of over 40 thousand Turkish citizens including civilians, children and even babies.
 
 This ruling based on the understanding that “even if one massacres people in other countries, there is no problem as long as it keeps quiet in mine” is an example of hypocrisy; ignores the fact that terrorism poses threat to all nations and encourages other terrorist organizations.
 
 The ruling that has been built on political criteria rather than legal ones and containing grave contradictions demonstrates that Belgian legislation is inconsistent with the acquis communautaires of the EU which Belgium hosts as a founding member. It has also revealed that Belgian legislation poses an obstacle for Belgium to fulfil its international obligations in relation to counterterrorism, primarily stemming from the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.
 
 We urge Belgian government to take all necessary steps to correct this desperate and contradictory ruling and to continue countering the PKK terrorist organization in an increasing manner.
 
 It is obvious that not only the PKK but also other terrorist organizations such as DAESH, which ruthlessly aimed Belgian people in the past, will exploit this irresponsible ruling. Therefore, we expect all responsible stakeholders to condemn this kind of attempts aiming to weaken international counterterrorism efforts.
 
 Standing on the right side of the history under all circumstances, Turkey will continue its fight against all forms of terrorism, which is one of biggest threats to humanity, both legally and through effective measures on the ground until the eradication of terrorist organizations."

 Permitting the ringleaders of the PKK, which is also enlisted by the EU as a terrorist organisation, to attend an event at the European Parliament and propagating terrorism therein amount to openly extending support to terrorism.
 
 We strongly condemn this unofficial event which also disregards the principle of countering terrorist organisations without discrimination.
 
 Allowing this event, violates the EU Directive 2017/541 on Combatting Terrorism and the decision of the Bureau of the the European Parliament Presidency dated 2 October 2017; thereby contradicts with the guidelines of the EU.
 
 On the other hand, it has been observed that the unjust ruling of the Belgian Supreme Court with respect to the Ariadna Case has encouraged certain circles within the European Parliament to support terrorism. We expect Belgium to accomplish necessary legislative work without delay in order to undo the aforementioned ruling and to cooperate with Turkey in the fight against terrorism.

These attempts are also completely contrary to the spirit of international cooperation in countering terrorism.

In view of these events, the importance of Turkey’s concrete achievements in its resolute fight against terrorism, within its borders and beyond is understood better. Efforts to provide a lifeline to the PKK terrorist organization which is in terminal decline as a result of Turkey’s successful operations are futile.
 
 Likewise, we condemn the harsh intervention of Austrian security forces that caused the injury of young people of Turkish origin as well as damage to business places belonging to the Turkish community.
 
 Ensuring public order and prevention of violence can only be possible by fighting terrorism in the correct manner. We urge the Austrian authorities to fight properly PKK which is recognized as a terrorist organization by the EU, and not to make of the issue material for populist politics. The Ambassador of Austria to Ankara will be summoned to the Ministry in order to share our concerns regarding the fact that the PKK-linked groups were allowed to organize rallies four days in a row and that the Austrian security forces used violence against the Turkish youth."

 It is tragicomic that those who came to power with the coup d'etat and threatened to intervene in Libya to support the putschist Haftar, like them, condemn our operations against terrorism.

She has previously met with the members of the terrorist organization and participated in the activities organized by persons affiliated with the terrorist organization. Minister Linde’s attitude, in respect of her position, raises serious questions about Sweden's stance as regards the fight against terrorism.
 
 The fact that there are members of the armed wing of the terrorist organization among those that she met intensifies the gravity of the situation. Minister Linde’s claim that she discussed Turkey’s counterterrorism operations in Syria with a terrorist is an exemplary case on its own. It is disgraceful that the so-called defenders of human rights, who turn out to be instrumental in the black propaganda of the terrorist organization, ignore these terrorists’ massacres in Syria, situation of civilians exiled and children forcibly recruited by the terrorists, as well as their atrocities against local populations including Kurds who do not embrace their separatist policies.

 alive and jeopardizing security and stability of the region.

 The provocative actions undertaken following the abovementioned terror attack by certain evil-minded groups that aim to disrupt the multi-ethnic structure of Kirkuk which represents a minor model of Iraq and the recent relative calm established in Iraq caused us real concern. 
 
 It is noteworthy that the Iraqi security authorities, not allowing the incidents to spin totally out of control, endeavoured to take necessary security measures to counter these actions aiming to derail the reconciliation and dialogue climate that is underway to be adopted by all parties in Kirkuk. 
 
 We hope that the people of Kirkuk will act with restraint, responsibility and common sense in the face of these provocative terror incidents which target to harm the peace and the stability of not only Kirkuk, but also Iraq and the entire region."

He is in Turkey to make an official visit, and after visiting our President and Speaker of the Assembly in the morning, we started our meetings here at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the first session of the morning, we discussed our bilateral relations.
 
 You know, the relations between Turkey and Romania are one that we can describe as perfect, no matter which way we look at them. Our high-level political contact traffic is quite intense, and our economic, cultural and military relations are also extremely close.
 
 Our diplomatic relations with Romania were established 130 years ago. We are also celebrating this today. On this occasion, we will open an exhibition together with the Guest Minister.
 
 Relations between us are based on mutual understanding and strong friendship. You know, we're allies in NATO. We have become a country that strongly supports Romania's NATO process and now Romania is a NATO member. At the same time, Romania is one of the two last member states to join the EU. Romania also gives strong support to our European Union process and I would like to thank especially my dear friend Lazar for this support. Also, the Balkan countries of Romania and Turkey. We are together in the South East European Cooperation Process. Romania and Turkey are also two countries bordering the Black Sea. Therefore, we are together in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization and Romania has decided to join the Black Sea Harmonization Programme; We will be together there again.
 
 There was a seminar in Bucharest at the beginning of this month and this seminar was extremely beneficial for us to benefit from Romania's experience. We received support from Romania for our candidacy for UN Security Council membership. I want to thank them again for this. Our trade volume last year reached 7 billion dollars. It looks like it will exceed $8 billion this year. Again, 390 thousand Romanian tourists visited our country last year. This year, the figure seems to exceed 400 thousand. Energy is another important area of ​​cooperation. In particular, the Nabucco project is an important project that concerns both countries and is supported by both countries. Again, with a power line that will pass under the Black Sea, we will be able to connect the electricity network in Turkey with the electricity network in Romania.
 
 There are many international and regional issues that concern both Turkey and Romania. Balkans, Caucasus, Middle East, Central Asia - my dear friend is coming to Turkey from Central Asia tour - in this whole geography, we have consultations with Romania and we are looking for potential cooperation. We will evaluate these regional issues at a working lunch today. Now I would like to leave the floor to my dear friend, Mr. Minister.
 
 GUEST MINISTER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I am very pleased to be with you. Seeing you in such a large number is proof of something. Actually, I knew that, but it was proven again today. The interest shown by the media stems from the importance attached by the friendly Turkish people to the relations between Romania and Turkey. I would like to thank Mr. Minister Babacan for his warm invitation and especially for the excellent program he has done for me. This program is being held at an extremely important time in the relations between the two countries. I am really happy today, because today we will celebrate the 130th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Romania, and on this occasion we will open this exhibition. Of course, there will be no such opportunity again, today is the only opportunity. Therefore, I would like to thank Minister Babacan. Because I will share a secret with you; I also mentioned this during our conversations. When you meet a person with whom you have a relationship with what we call personal chemistry, and diplomatic experience is added to it, it turns out that you will have a lot.
 
 Turkey is on the way to the EU. Romania has gone through this process. I served as the Ambassador of Romania's Permanent Representation to the EU and worked there for more than 7 years. Therefore, I am a person who knows very well what these negotiations are. Talking about these negotiations, Romania supports Turkey. Turkey's membership will make an important contribution not only for Turkey but also for the EU. Therefore, if we look at it from a regional and EU perspective, not unilaterally, Turkey's membership to the EU is extremely important. There is a success story for the EU. This is due to the fact that he stands behind his commitments. At the moment, the EU has made a commitment: it promised Turkey membership. This is very important. It's also very important to us.
 
 I agree with what Minister Babacan said. Relations between our countries are excellent. The fact that there are frequent meetings at the level of Presidents, Prime Ministers and we, at the level of Foreign Ministers, indicates that our relations in the political field are very excellent. Our bilateral and regional consultations are frequent. There are also relations in the international arena. On this occasion, I would like to congratulate Turkey once again for being elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council with a large percentage of votes.
 
 There is a global economic crisis today. But we must have a common goal. We want our trade volume to reach at least 10 billion dollars in 2010. We have decided to make the necessary efforts at the level of Foreign Ministries as well. We have opportunities. I think the best way to overcome this crisis is to continue the development process. There are efforts and thoughts in this direction both in Turkey and Romania. At the same time, we both believe that we can realize joint projects in third markets. I come from Central Asia and I really saw the talent and capacity of Turkish businessmen there. They are involved in very positive projects there. I have said it before, and I will say it again, and I will tell businessmen in Romania to be inspired by the success story of Turkish businessmen. Because in Africa,
 
 We also talked about our regional cooperation. For example, in the case of the Black Sea. Internal procedures for Romania's participation in the Black Sea Harmonization Program have been completed. At the same time, we can cooperate within the BSEC and in the Black Sea region. We can cooperate in the South East Europe process.
 
 In the meetings we held, we also talked about the global crisis and put forward our ideas. We also talked about the importance of the Turkish community in Romania and the significant contribution of the Turkish business community in Romania. They are genuine bridges for our bilateral relations. That's why our relationships are perfect. I want to emphasize this again. They will grow after that. For example, I attended a dinner organized by TOBB last night. As I understand from the speech made by the host before we get into the economic aspects, we have a lot of common words, especially in the kitchen and food areas. If we think that food and food are at the foundation of every person's life, you can understand how deep the values ​​and relationships between us are. Thank you.
 
 MINISTER: If there are friends who want to ask questions to the visiting Minister or me, let's take a few questions, then we will go to the exhibition opening together.
 
 QUESTION: We know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia will arrive in Istanbul on Monday. To what extent will you meet with him, what issues will you bring to the table, and what messages will you deliver? Thank you.
 
 OUR MINISTER: Mr. Nalbandian's arrival in Istanbul will be on the 24th and we will meet him for a dinner. The topics are ones that you won't have a hard time guessing, I think. Relationships. What can be done. You know, our aim in this dialogue process is full normalization. However, mutual steps must be taken to reach that point. Currently, these negotiations in the region continue not only between Turkey and Armenia, but also between Azerbaijan and Armenia. There are two separate lines here. But we will also ensure the coordination of these two separate lines in the tripartite meetings we will hold once in a while. You know, the last time Mr. Sarkisyan and Mr. Aliyev had a Moscow meeting. We have learned that the results of that meeting were also positive. There is a new climate for solving problems in the region. This is an important window of opportunity, but I think this window of opportunity should be used well. Because - I say it often - the term window is important, because windows open, but when the time comes, these windows can be closed. Therefore, while this window of opportunity is open, I think that all parties should act quickly for the rapid normalization of both Armenia-Azerbaijan relations and the relations between Turkey and Armenia.
 
 QUESTION: Yesterday in Baghdad, the Tripartite Commission held its first meeting in order to improve cooperation in the fight against the PKK. Could you give us some information about the concrete decisions made at this meeting? Also, has a place and date been determined for the next meeting?
 
 There is also an agreement in Iraq that the Americans and Iraqis have reached. Within the framework of this agreement, it is envisaged that the airspace will be transferred to Iraqi control as of January 1. Although this agreement has not yet passed the parliament, it is considered certain that it will pass. How does this affect Turkey's air operations against Northern Iraq?
 
 OUR MINISTER: First of all, as you know, today we have a guest from Iraq regarding this security agreement that has been signed but has not yet been submitted to Parliament's approval. Minister of State Ekrem El-Hakim. He will also visit me this afternoon. We will talk about these issues in detail. Undoubtedly, this agreement is an agreement that closely concerns neighboring countries. Undoubtedly, the Iraqi Parliament will make the final decision on the agreement. But we, of course, convey our views and approaches regarding this agreement to both the Iraqi side and the American side, as we have done so far. Right now, we are fighting against the PKK, the separatist terrorist organization. And it's a fight that's getting wider and wider. Not just military instruments anymore, It is a struggle in which many other instruments have come into play. While we were fighting this struggle, we cooperated very closely with both the USA and the Iraqi Central Government. In other words, the Iraqi government has also supported our operations so far. They have told us in our various meetings that it is natural for Turkey to do this as they do not have the means and capacities in the North at the moment. Therefore, the meeting we held yesterday is also important. You know, I have mentioned before and mentioned a triple mechanism. Of course, this triple mechanism should not be confused with the previous ones. During this period, our Minister of Interior held a meeting with his Iraqi counterparts yesterday in an environment attended by US officials. Iraq-Turkey-USA trilateral meeting. In this meeting, There were not only the Ministries of Interior, but also military officials from all three sides, and other relevant organizations of all three sides were represented. At the meeting, it was reaffirmed that the PKK is a terrorist organization for all three sides. It was decided to repeat these meetings approximately every two months, but to continue the work with sub-committees on a daily basis between meetings to be held every two months.
 
 As Iraq's own security and defense capacity strengthens, the United States will gradually withdraw its military presence there out of Iraq. This is the essence of the newly signed agreement. Iraq now owns more of its own issues and feels more ownership in solving its own problems. There can be no more natural development than that some of the works we have carried out together with the USA are carried out with the participation of Iraq in the next phases. I can say that both the military authorities of Iraq and other relevant state units will be more intensely involved in future studies. Yesterday's meeting was very productive. Our friends are also extremely satisfied with the results. As you know, our Special Representative for Iraq Murat Özçelik stayed in Baghdad. He will continue his contacts there for another four or five days. Because there are always important developments regarding Iraq. In order to follow these issues closely in the field, we asked him to stay there for a while. Our Minister of Interior and our delegation have returned from Baghdad as of last night.
 
 Let's give a word to our friends who have questions to the guest minister.
 
 QUESTION: Romania is one of the last countries to join the EU. What did you expect before joining the union and did you find what you expected? As you know, Turkey is also a candidate country and there are intense discussions in Turkey about whether membership to the European Union is necessary. What advice can you give in this regard?
 
 GUEST MINISTER: My answer is very short and without hesitation, “yes”. All our expectations were met. After becoming a member, we achieved everything we wanted, expected and aimed for. I mean there is something else. Before becoming a member, we tried to immediately feel their benefits when the end of the negotiation process and the membership process was approached. Because he made a great contribution to the modernization of Romania. This is very important. Second, you know there's a transition period. After signing the accession agreement in 2005, Romania participated in many meetings only as a participant. These meetings were very important meetings related to our region. As an example, the Black Sea Synergy Initiative was launched at the beginning of this year, with the participation and assistance of many countries.
 
 Considering that one of the most important dimensions of European structures is credit policies, it also concerns Romania's interests in terms of resources. Thus, 37 billion EURO will come to Romania. Especially if we are going to think within the framework of this financial statement, we can all say that EU membership is only positive. I have said this at other times, and I will repeat it now, our membership in the EU will add value to the EU. EU neighborhood policies, especially after the developments in Georgia, the initiatives launched by the EU under the French Presidency were very important. At that time, we proved that we also have an added value in that table. I'm sure the same will be true for Turkey. It will also provide an added value. In particular, it will provide a much more significant added value after becoming a member.
 
 MINISTER: Thank you."
